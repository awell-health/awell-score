# Constant–Murley Score - OrthoToolKit version

## Introduction

The Constant–Murley Score (CMS) was introduced as an instrument to evaluate overall shoulder function, irrespective of diagnosis [1]. After the approval and recommendation of the European Society for Surgery of the Shoulder and the Elbow, the CMS became a widely used tool. In 2008, modifications to the score have been suggested by Constant et al. [2]

The CMS asses two subjective aspects answered by the patient: pain and activities of daily living (ADL) and two objective aspects answered by the orthopedic surgeon or the physiotherapist: range of motion (ROM) and strength. The subjective components can receive up to 35 points and the objective 65, resulting in a possible maximum total score of 100 points (best function) [1,3].

### OrthoToolKit version

Multiple versions of the Constant Murley Score are circulating. This calculation is based of the OrthoToolKit version and should therefore be used with the same form.

## Questionnaire

The Constant-Murley score contains both physician-completed and patient-reported portions. 

**There are four scales:**
1. Pain (15 possible points)
2. Activities of daily living (20 possible points)
3. Mobility (40 possible points)
4. Strength (25 possible points)

## Calculation

### Pain scale

The pain scale only has one item, a VAS slider ranging from 0 to 15 points, which directly represents the score for the pain scale.

### ADL scale

The ADL scale has 4 items which are summed to get the ADL scale score.

### Moblity scale

The mobility scale has 4 items (flexion, abduction, internal & external rotation):
1. Scores for flexion, adbuction & internal rotation are summed
2. The score for external rotation is determined by counting all checked items. Each checked item represents two points.
3. Scores from point 1 and 2 are summed to obtain the mobility scale score

### Strength scale

The	score is calculated	from the highest score of 3 attempts. The score in points corresponds to the force in pounds (max 25 points).

**Note:**
We measure strength in kilograms so the entered values are multiplied by 2.2

### Total scale

The sum of all the scores above.

## Interpretation

The total CMS scores ranges from 0 points (most disability) to 100 points (least disability).
