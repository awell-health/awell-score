# Health-Related Quality of Life - Healthy Days Core Module (CDC HRQOL–4)

## Introduction

Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a multi-dimensional concept commonly used to examine the impact of health status on quality of life. HRQOL can be measured by four core questions that ask about general health status and number of unhealthy days in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

## Measurement

**CDC uses a set of questions called the “Healthy Days Measures.” These questions include the following:**
1. Would you say that in general your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?
2. Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?
3. Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?
4. During the past 30 days, approximately how many days did poor physical or mental health keep you from doing your usual activities, such as self-care, work, or recreation?

## Calculation

### Summary index of unhealthy days

Unhealthy days are an estimate of the overall number of days during the previous 30 days when the respondent felt that either his or her physical or mental health was not good. 

To obtain this estimate, responses to questions 2 and 3 are combined to calculate a summary index of overall unhealthy days, with a logical maximum of 30 unhealthy days.

> For example, a person who reports 4 physically unhealthy days and 2 mentally unhealthy days is assigned a value of 6 unhealthy days, and someone who reports 30 physically unhealthy days and 30 mentally unhealthy days is assigned the maximum of 30 unhealthy days.

### Summary index of healthy days

Healthy days are the positive complementary form of unhealthy days. 

Healthy days estimates the number of recent days when a person’s physical and mental health was good (or better) and is calculated by subtracting the number of unhealthy days from 30 days.
