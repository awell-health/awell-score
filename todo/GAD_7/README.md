# Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)

## Introduction

This easy-to-use self-administered patient questionnaire is used as a screening tool and severity measure for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [1,2].

## Calculation

This is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the response categories, respectively, of “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days”, and “nearly every day”. GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21.

## Interpretation

Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.

| Score | Symptom Severity | Comments                                  |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 5-9   | Mild             | Monitor                                   |
| 10-14 | Moderate         | Possible clinically significant condition |
| >15   | Severe           | Active treatment probably warranted       |

Using the threshold score of 10, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% for GAD. It is moderately good at screening three other common anxiety disorders - panic disorder (sensitivity 74%, specificity 81%), social anxiety disorder (sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (sensitivity 66%, specificity 81%).[3]
