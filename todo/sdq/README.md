# Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)

## Introduction

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire is used to measure pro-social behaviour, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems.

It's a 25-items measure with 5 subscales of 5 items each. It is usually easiest to score all 5 scales first before working out the total difficulties score. For each of the 5 scales the score can range from 0 to 10 if all items were completed. These scores can be scaled up pro-rata if at least 3 items were completed, e.g. a score of 4 based on 3 completed items can be scaled up to a score of 7 (6.67 rounded up) for 5 items.

### Impact supplement

Our calculation supports using a version of the SDQ that includes an ‘impact supplement’, the items on overall distress and impairment can be summed to generate an impact score that ranges from 0 to 10 for parent- and self-report, and from 0 to 6 for teacher-report.

## Calcuation

### Calculate score for each subscale

For each of the 5 scales the score can range from 0 to 10 if all items were completed. These scores can be scaled up pro-rata if at least 3 items were completed, e.g. a score of 4 based on 3 completed items can be scaled up to a score of 7 (6.67 rounded up) for 5 items.

A score for the impact part is also calculated during this step.

### Calculate a total score

This is generated by summing scores from all the scales (emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity & peer problems) except the prosocial scale. The resultant score ranges from 0 to 40, and is counted as missing of one of the 4 component scores is missing.

### Calculate internalising & externalising score

The externalising score ranges from 0 to 20 and is the sum of the conduct and hyperactivity scales. The internalising score ranges from 0 to 20 and is the sum of the emotional and peer problems scales. Using these two amalgamated scales may be preferable to using the four separate scales in community samples, whereas using the four separate scales may add more value in high-risk samples[1].

### Add categorisation scores

The calculation in Awell returns interpretation for the full categorisation table (parent-completed, teacher-completed and self-completed).

#### Three-band categorisation

Although SDQ scores can be used as continuous variables, it is sometimes convenient to categorise scores. 

The initial bandings presented for the SDQ scores were:
- ‘normal’
- ‘borderline’
- ‘abnormal’.

These bandings were defined based on a population-based UK survey, attempting to choose cutpoints such that 80% of children scored ‘normal’, 10% ‘borderline’ and 10% ‘abnormal’.

#### Four-band categorisation

More recently a four-fold classification has been created based on an even larger UK community sample. This four-fold classification differs from the original in that it:
1. Divided the top ‘abnormal’ category into two groups, each containing around 5% of the population
2. Renamed the four categories (80% ‘close to average’, 10% ‘slightly raised, 5% ‘high’ and 5% ‘very high’ for all scales except prosocial, which is 80% ‘close to average’, 10% ‘slightly lowered’, 5% ‘low’ and 5% ‘very low’)
3. Changed the cut-points for some scales, to better reflect the proportion of children in each category in the larger dataset.
