# AUDIT Score for alcohol use
## Introduction
The World Health Organization’s Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a very reliable and simple screening tool which is sensitive to early
detection of risky and high risk (or hazardous and harmful) drinking [1,2]. It has three questions on alcohol consumption (1 to 3), three questions on drinking
behaviour and dependence (4 to 6) and four questions on the consequences or problems related to drinking (7 to 10).

## Scoring

* Questions 1 to 8 are scored on a five-point scale from 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
* Questions 9 & 10 are scored on a three -point scale from 0, 2 and 4.
* Total score can be calculated by summing all the answers on the 10 questions. The maximum score is 40.

### Consumption score
**Add up questions 1 to 3** (maximum score possible = 12). 

A score of 6 or 7 may indicate a risk of alcohol-related harm, even if this is also the total score for the AUDIT (e.g. consumption could be over the recommended weekly intake of 28 for men and 14 for females in the absence of scoring on any other questions). Drinking may also take place in dangerous situations (e.g. driving, fishing/boating). Scores of 6 to 7 may also indicate potential harm for those groups more susceptible to the effects of alcohol, such as young people, women, the elderly, people with mental health problems and people on medication. Further inquiry may reveal the necessity for harm reduction advice.

### Dependence score
**Add up questions 4 to 6** (maximum score possible = 12). 

In addition to the total AUDIT score, a secondary ‘dependence’ score of 4 or more as a subtotal of questions 4 to 6, suggests the possibility of alcohol dependence (and therefore the need for more intensive intervention if further assessment confirms dependence).

### Alcohol-related problems score
Any scoring on questions 7 to 10 warrants further investigation to determine whether the problem is of current concern and requires intervention
