# Pain Coping Inventory

## Introduction

The Pain Coping Inventory (PCI), designed by Kraaimaat and Evers [1], measures cognitive and behavioural pain-coping strategies.

## Questions and Scoring

The questionnaire can be found under the following link:

The PCI contains 33 questions, which can be pooled into 6 domains of cognitive and behavioural strategies for dealing with chronic pain: pain transformation, distraction, reducing demands, retreating, worrying, and resting. These domains can be grouped into active (transformation, distraction, reducing demands) and passive (retreating, worrying, resting) pain-coping dimensions. 

- Factor 1: Pain Transformation - Questions 15,16,18,30
- Factor 2: Distraction - 9,19,20,21,22
- Factor 3: Reducing Demands - 2,3,4
- Factor 4: Retreating - 10,11,12,13,14,32,33
- Factor 5: Worrying - 17,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,31
- Factor 6: Resting - 1,5,6,7,8

The questions are rated according to a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (hardly ever) to 4 (very often) in terms of the frequency with which strategies are applied when dealing with pain. Passive pain-coping reflects three cognitive-behavioural strategies, assessing behavioural tendencies to restrict functioning (resting, five items), to avoid environmental stimuli (retreating, seven items) and catastrophic cognitions about the pain (worrying, nine items).

The first 3 domains (Pain Transformation, Distraction, Reducing Demands) of the PCI define active coping strategies, whereas the last 3 domains (Retreating, Worrying, Resting) define passive strategies.

## Calculations

The score of each domain is calculated by adding all the scores. Additionally, a score for the active coping strategy (12-36) and passive strategy (21-63) is determined by the sum of the domain belonging to these categories. The percentage of each category is calculated as well, by dividing the individual category score by the maximum possible score times 100.
