# EORTC QLQ-LC29

## Introduction

This questionnaire is an updated of the EORTC QLQ-LC13. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was the first module developed to be used in conjunction with the core questionnaire C30. Since the publication of the LC13 in 1994, major advances have been made in the treatment of lung cancer as well as in assessing quality of life. Therefore, the EORTC decided to support a project to update the LC13. [1]

The update of the EORTC questionnaire for assessing quality of life in lung cancer follows a rigorous methodology including patient involvement on various levels. The updated questionnaire after Phases 1 to 3 comprises, in addition to the original items, new items related to the side-effects of targeted therapies and surgery. The updated module currently undergoes full validation and psychometric testing in a cross-cultural, multicenter Phase 4 study, involving 19 centers from 12 different countries. The updated module should become the new standard for quality of life assessment in lung cancer clinical trials.

The QLQ-LC29 incorporates 5 multi-item scales to assess symptom or quality of life issues. In addition, 5 single items assess symptoms.

**Remarks:**
- “Item range” is the difference between the possible maximum and the minimum response to individual items. All items are scored 1 to 4, giving range = 3

## Calculations

[Complete scoring manual can be found here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kh7Q_0Bf2LuMRsfLUlK3sU-Wm9ITY2a0/view?usp=sharing)

### Raw score

For all scales, the Raw Score, RS, is the mean of the component items:

```
Raw score = RS = sum of all items / amount of items
``` 

### Linear Transformation

To obtain the Score S, standardize the raw score to a 0 – 100 range following the appropriate transformation:

1. Symptom scales
```
S = ((RS−1)/range) × 100
```

## Missing data

* Have at least half of the items from the scale been answered?
* If Yes, use all the items that were completed, and apply the standard equations given on the previous pages for calculating the scale scores; ignore any items with missing values when making the calculations.
* If No, set scale score to missing.
* For single-item measures, set score to missing.
