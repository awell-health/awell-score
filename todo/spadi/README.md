# Shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI)

## Introduction

The shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) [1] is a self-report questionnaire developed to measure the pain and disability associated with shoulder pathology. The SPADI consists of two dimensions. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various  activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI was originally published as a VAS scale, and subsequently validated as numeric scale of 0â€“10 [2].

## Questions and Scoring

The SPADI consists of 13 items in two subscales: pain (5 items) and disability (8 items). Verbal anchors for the pain dimension are "no pain at all" (0) and "worst pain imaginable," (10) and those for the functional activities are "no difflciulty" (0) and "so difficult it required help." (10) 

Pain dimension: How severe is your pain?
- 1. At its worst?
- 2. When lying on the involved side?
- 3. Reaching for something on a high shelf?
- 4. Touching the back of your neck?
- 5. Pushing with the involved arm?

Disability dimension: How much difficulty do you have?
- 1. Washing your hair?
- 2. Washing your back?
- 3. Putting on an underskirt or pullover sweater?
- 4. Putting on a shirt that buttons down the front?
- 5. Putting on your pants?
- 6. Placing an object on a high shelf?
- 7. Carrying a heavy object (eg, 10 Ib)?
- 8. Removing something from your back pocket? 

## Missing data

In scoring SPADI, any question missed should be taken out of the total score of each subscale. i.e if 1 question is omitted in the pain section, the total score is divided by 40.

## Calculations

Each dimension score is calculated in % by adding up each item score, dividing it through the maximum score of each dimension (i.g. 50 for the pain dimension), times 100.

The scores from both dimensions are averaged to derive a total score. 

## Interpretation

The total score ranges from 0 (best) to 100 (worst).
