# Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FND)

The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. The test was designed to provide an ordinal measure of nicotine dependence related to cigarette smoking. It contains six items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence.

## Scoring

In scoring the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, yes/no items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple-choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10. The higher the total Fagerström score, the more intense is the patient's physical dependence on nicotine.

## Interpretation

| Score | Interpretation             |
|-------|----------------------------|
| 0-2   | Low dependence             |
| 3-4   | Low to moderate dependence |
| 5-7   | Moderate dependence        |
| >8    | High dependence            |
