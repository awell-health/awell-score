# Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9)

## Introduction

The PHQ-9 is a validated, 9-question tool to assess for the degree of depression present in an individual; the last question is not scored, but is useful functionally to help the clinician assess the impact of the patient's symptoms on his or her life.

## Calculation

All 9 questions are simply summed to obtain the total score.

## Interpretation

| Score | Depression severity | Comments                                                                                            |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 5-9   | Mild                | Use clinical judgment (symptom duration, functional impairment) to determine necessity of treatment |
