# COMPASS 31 (Composite Autonomic Symptom Score)

COMPASS 31 is a refined, internally consistent, and markedly abbreviated quantitative measure of autonomic symptoms. It is based on the original ASP and COMPASS, applies a much simplified scoring algorithm, and is suitable for widespread use in autonomic research and practice.

## Scoring

The raw domain scores are derived by adding the points for the questions comprising each domain (see table below). Where an answer to a question is not assigned a point, the score for that answer is zero.

| Domain                  | Item | Raw answer | Points |
|-------------------------|------|------------|--------|
| Orthostatic Intolerance | 1    | 1          | 1      |

The final domain scores are generated by multiplying the raw score with a weight index (see table below). The total score is the sum of all domain scores.

## Missing data

No methodology was described for handling missing data. If no answers are given, the scores for all domains and the total score will be set to 0.
