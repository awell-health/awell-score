# Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10)

## Introduction

The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) is a 10-item brief screening tool that can be administered by a clinician or self-administered. Each question requires a yes or no response, and the tool can be completed in less than 8 minutes. This tool assesses drug use, not including alcohol or tobacco use, in the past 12 months.

## Questionnaire

[View English version of the DAST-10 questionnaire](https://drive.google.com/file/d/124zD62ByzQ-m9raN1pYjiXLNckDxhZNR/view?usp=sharing).

Please note that the answer values for question #3 are the inverse of all other questions (1 = no, 0 = yes). We expect that the incoming data for the calculation takes this into account as the calculation takes the sum of all numerical values (i.e. the calculation doesn't manipulate or transform any incoming data).

## Calculation

Patients receive 1 point for every "yes" answer with the exception of question #3, for which a "no" answer receives 1 point.

## Interpretation

| Score | Interpretation       | Suggested action                   |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 0     | No problems reported | None at this time                  |
| 1-2   | Low level            | Monitor, re-assess at a later date |
| 3-5   | Moderate level       | Further investigation              |
| 6-8   | Substantial level    | Intensive assessment               |
| 9-10  | Severe level         | Intensive assessment               |

## Missing data

A score is calculated when at least 1 question is answered.
