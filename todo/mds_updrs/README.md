# The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)

## Introduction

The MDS‐UPDRS is a 4‐subscale scale that comprehensively assesses the symptoms of PD and consists of:
1. Part I, nonmotor experiences of daily living, including 13 items (6 semistructured interview items and 7 self‐reported items)
2. Part II, motor experiences of daily living, including 13 self‐reported items
3. Part III, motor examination, including 18 items (33 scores)
4. Part IV, motor complications, including 6 items assessed in a semistructured inteview

All items are scored on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe), and total scores are obtained from the sum of the corresponding item scores. The total MDS-UPDRS score ranges from 0 to 260 [1].

## Score calculation

For all 4 scales a score is calculated, this is done by summing all the individual responses in that scale. 

A total score is calculated by summing the 4 scale scores.
