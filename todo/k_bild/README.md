# King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (K-BILD) health status questionnaire

The Kingâ€™s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (KBILD) is a 15-item validated health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire. 

The KBILD questionnaire will help measure the impact of ILD on the wellbeing and daily life of the patient. It can be used to monitor a patient's condition condition and assess how well the treatment is working. It is intended to be completed regularly (eg: with each clinic visit) or at home but it can be completed more frequently (for example every 3 months).



## Domains

The final K-BILD questionnaire consisted of 15 items and three domains:
1. Breathlessness and activities: questions 1, 4, 11, 13
2. Psychological: questions 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14
3. Chest symptoms: questions 2, 7, 9

A total score can also be calculated by summing the scores of all 15 items/questions.

## Scoring

Every item or question is scored on a seven-point (1-7) Likert scale.

A total score and three domain scores are calculated. For each of the 4 scores (total score + 3 domain scores), we calculate the raw score (sum of the raw answers) and the transformed score (scale 0-100).
