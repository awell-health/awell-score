# The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5)

The 5-question International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire is a validated, multidimensional, self-administered investigation that has been found useful in the clinical assessment of erectile
dysfunction and treatment outcomes in clinical trials.

## Questionnaire

A score of 1-5 (Q1) and 0-5 (Q2-Q5) is awarded to the five questions. The total score thus ranges from 1 to 25.

## Scoring

The IIEF-5 score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 5 items.

## Interpretation

- 22-25: No erectile dysfunction
- 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction
- 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction
- 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction
- 1-7: Severe erectile dysfunction
