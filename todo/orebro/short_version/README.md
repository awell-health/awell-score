# 10 item Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (ÖMPSQ-10)

## Introduction 

The Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (ÖMSPQ) was developed as a tool to assist in the early identification  of  yellow  flags  and  patients  risking  the  development of work disability due to the pain [1]. The ÖMSPQ has 25 items of which 21 are scored and it has satisfactory psychometric properties and predictive ability. [2]  However, calls have been made for tools with the greatest clinical utility, that is, being short and easy to administer [3]. Therfore Linton et al. reported on the development and validation of a short version of the ÖMPSQ in 2011 [4].

## Questions and Scoring

The items/questions of the short version cover the following factors: self-perceived  function,  pain  experience,  distress,  fear-avoidance  beliefs,  and  return  to work expectancy. Participants rate the items on 0 to 10 point scales anchored by extremes, for example, “no pain—pain as bad as it could be”  or  “completely  disagree—completely  agree.”  The  item  on  duration  however,  has  10  categories  ranging  from  0  to  1  week  to  more  than  52  weeks.

| Question | Score |
| ------ | ------ |
| How long have you had your current pain problem? | 1–10 |
| How would you rate the pain that you have had during the past week | 0–10 |
| Please circle the one number that best describes your current ability to participate in each of these activities |  |
| I can do light work for an hour. | 10-0 |
| I can sleep at night.| 10-0 |
| How tense or anxious have you felt in the past week? | 0–10 |
| How much have you been bothered by feeling de-pressed in the past week? | 0–10 |
| In your view, how large is the risk that your current pain may become persistent?| 0–10 |
| In your estimation, what are the chances you will be working your normal duties in 3 mo | 10-0 |
| An increase in pain is an indication that I should stop what I’m doing until the pain decreases. | 0–10 |
| I should not do my normal work with my present pain | 0–10 | 


## Calculations

Te scores of each question are summed up and a total score of > 49 is returned as Positive.

## Interpretation

Scores may range from 1 to 100.

Higher scores indicate higher levels of estimated risk for developing pain related disability.
