# Modified Caregiver Strain Index

## Introduction

The Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI) is an easy-to-use tool that can quickly screen for caregiver strain in long-term caregivers. The tool has 13 questions that measure strain related to care provision[1].

## Scoring

Scoring is 2 points for each 'yes', 1 point for each 'sometimes', and 0 for each ‘no’ response.

## Calculation

All scores are summed.

## Missing data

All questions should be answered in order to calculate a score.

## Interpretation

Scoring ranges from 26 to 0; a higher score indicates a higher level of caregiver strain.
