# Mini-BESTest: Balance Evaluation Systems Test

## Introduction

This clinical balance assessment tool is a shortened version of the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) a balance assessment tool with focuses on “dynamic balance” [1]. It aims to target and identify 6 different balance control systems so that specific rehabilitation approaches can be designed for different balance deficits. The BESTest was shortened based on factor analysis to include dynamic balance only and to improve clinical utilization [2].

## Questionnaire (scoring form)

The Mini BESTest is a 14-item test scored on a 3-level ordinal scale [0, 2].

Mini BESTest assesses dynamic balance, a unidimensinal construct and includes 14 items addressing 4 of the 6 sections of the original BESTest:

| Sections                          	| Questions 	| Subscore 	|
|-----------------------------------	|-----------	|----------	|
| Anticipatory postural adjustments 	| [1, 3]    	| 6        	|
| Reactive postural control         	| [4, 6]    	| 6        	|
| Sensory orientation               	| [7, 9]    	| 6        	|
| Dynamic gait                      	| [10, 14]  	| 10       	|
| Total score                       	| [1, 14]   	| 28       	|

### Question 3 & 6

Question 3 & 6 have right and left assessment in which the lower score is used within the total score.

## Calculation

Scores are calculated by summing all the answers per section.
