# Oxford Hip Score (OHS)

## Introduction 
The OHS is a joint specific patient-centred outcome measure that was devised in 1996 by Murray et al. [1] The OHS is designed to
assess pain and functional ability from the patientâ€™s perspective. It consists of 12 questions which were originally reated from 1 to 5, with 1 representing best outcome and 5 the worst. This original OHS scoring has since be revised and each question is now scored from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating the best outcome.[2] The OHS has been shown to have particularly high responsiveness, is easy to use and can be completed by
patients independent of clinicians. The OHS has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive to change in patients undergoing primary
THR [1] and revision THR.[3] It is internally consistent, reproducible and valid.[4]

**Awell only supports the 0 to 4 scoring system.**

## Questions and Scoring

The OHS questions used to calculate the score are as follows:

Please answer the following 12 multiple choice questions. During the past 4 weeks.

| Question | Answer and Score |
| ----- | ----- |
| How would you describe the pain you usually have in your hip?| None = 4; Very mild = 3; Mild = 2; Moderate = 1; Severe = 0 |
| Have you been troubled by pain from your hip in bed at night?| No nights = 4; Only 1 or 2 nights = 3; Some nights = 2; Most nights = 1; Every night =0 |
| Have you had any sudden, severe pain (shooting, stabbing, or spasms) from your affected hip? | No days = 4; Only 1 or 2 days = 3; Some days
= 2; Most days = 1; Every day = 0 |
| Have you been limping when walking because of your hip? | Rarely/never = 4; Sometimes, or just at first = 3; Often, not just at first = 2; Most of the time = 1; All of the time = 0 |
| For how long have you been able to walk before the pain in your hip becomes severe (with or without a walking aid)? | No pain/More than 30 minutes = 4; 16 to 30 minutes = 3; 5 to 15 minutes = 2; Around the house only = 1; Not at all/pain severe on walking = 0 |
| Have you been able to climb a flight of stairs? | Yes, easily = 4; With little difficulty = 3; With moderate difficulty = 2; With extreme difficulty = 1; No, impossible = 0 |
| Have you been able to put on a pair of socks, stockings or tights? | Yes, easily = 4; With little difficulty = 3; With moderate difficulty = 2; With extreme difficulty = 1; No, impossible = 0 |
|After a meal (sat at a table), how painful has it been for you to stand up from a chair because of your hip? | Not at all painful = 4; Slightly painful = 3; Moderately painful =2; Very painful = 1; Unbearable = 0 |
| Have you had any trouble getting in and out of a car or using public transportation because of your hip? | No trouble at all = 4; Very little trouble = 3; Moderate trouble = 2; Extreme difficulty = 1; Impossible to do = 0 |
| Have you had any trouble with washing and drying yourself (all over) because of your hip? | No trouble at all = 4; Very little trouble = 3; Moderate trouble = 2; Extreme difficulty = 1; Impossible to do = 0 |
| Could you do the household shopping on your own? | Yes, easily = 4; With little difficulty = 3; With moderate difficulty = 2; With extreme difficulty = 1; No, impossible = 0 |
| How much has pain from your hip interfered with your usual work, including housework | Not at all = 4; A little bit = 3; Moderately = 2; Greatly = 1; Totally = 0 |


## Calculations

The OHS is calculated by adding up the scores of each individual question. If more than two questions are unanswered Awell recommends that an overall score should not be calculated.

## Interpretation

The OHS represents a continuous score ranging from 0 (most severe symptoms) to 48 (least symptoms).
