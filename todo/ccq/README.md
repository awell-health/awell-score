# Clinical COPD Quesitonnaire (CCQ)

## Introduction 

The CCQ is a self-administered questionnaire specially developed to measure clinical control in patients with COPD[1].

## Questions and Scoring

**The questions in the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) are divided into three areaâ€™s, or domains:**
1. Symptoms: items 1, 2, 5 and 6
2. Functional state: items 7, 8, 9 and 10
3. Mental state: items 3 and 4

## Missing data

You should make large effort to prevent missing data! When data is missing or answers are ambiguous (e.g. double answers) the following rules have to be applied to calculate the CCQ scores.

| Domain           | # of items in domain | # of items required |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Symptoms         | 4                    | 3                   |
| Functional state | 4                    | 3                   |
| Mental state     | 2                    | 2                   |

When data is missing, the total CCQ score can still be calculated if the individual domains can be calculated.

## Calculation

### Domain scores

The domain scores are calculated by adding the scores of all the items in that domain and dividing that number by the number of items in that domain.

### Total score

The total score is calculated by adding the scores of the ten items and dividing that number by ten (= number of items).

## Interpretation

The total CCQ score, and the score on each of the three domains, varies between 0 (very good health status) to 6 (extremely poor health status).
