# The Pain Disability Index (PDI)

The Pain Disability Index (PDI) a simple and rapid instrument for measuring the impact that pain has on the ability of a person to participate in essential life activities. This can be used to evaluate patients initially to monitor them over time and to judge the effectiveness of interventions. The index was developed at St. Louis University Medical Center.

## Scoring

The Pain Disability Index is calculated by summing up the points for all seven questions.

### Total PDI Score

The Pain Disability Index ranges from 0, indicating minimal disability, to 70, representing maximal disability. A higher index value suggests a greater level of disability resulting from pain.
