# Patient Specific Functional Scale

## Introduction 

Patient Specific Functional Scale was developed by Stratford et al 1995 as a self-report outcome measure of function that could be used in patients with varying levels of independence [1]. The aim of PSFS is to provide clinicians with a valid, reliable, responsive and efficient outcome measure that would be easy to use and applicable to a large number of clinical presentations [2].

### Method of use

1. Patients are asked to identify up to five important activities they are unable to perform or are having difficulty with as a result of their problem eg putting socks on, shopping.
2. Patients are asked to rate (on an 11-point scale, [0,10]) the current level of difficulty associated with each activity. 
3. "0" represents “unable to perform” and "10" represents “able to perform at prior level”
4. Patients select a value that best describes their current level of ability on each activity assessed.

## Questions and Scoring

| Input id              | Question                                 | Answer options |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| SCORE_FOR_ACTIVITY_01 | Activity scoring for the first activity  | VAS [0,10]     |
| SCORE_FOR_ACTIVITY_02 | Activity scoring for the second activity | VAS [0,10]     |
| SCORE_FOR_ACTIVITY_03 | Activity scoring for the third activity  | VAS [0,10]     |
| SCORE_FOR_ACTIVITY_03 | Activity scoring for the fourth activity | VAS [0,10]     |

## Calculation

**The calculation will return the following:**
1. Sum of all the activity scores
2. Number of activities that were indicated by the patient
3. Total score where the sum of the activity scores is divided by the number of activities

## Interpretation

A lower score indicates problems performing the activities.
