# COMI Neck

## Introduction

The COMI is a validated multidimensional questionnaire for assessing the key outcomes of importance to patients with back (or neck) problems. Being brief, it is associated with minimal respondent burden and high completion rates [1-2]. The comi back questions have been adapted for the cervical spine, by enquiring about neck rather than back problems, and it too showed good validity and reliability [3]. Additionally further studies showed that the COMI neck is a valid and responsive instrument for use in assessing the outcome of patients undergoing cervical spine surgery [4].

## Scoring

The COMI neck is scored similar to the comi back.

- The higher of the two pain scores (item 1a and 1b) is taken as the "pain" score.
- The average of the two disability items (items 5 and 6) forms the disability score.

The five domain scores for pain (higher of items 1a and 1b), neck-related function (item 2), symptom-specific well-being (item 3), general quality of life (item 4) and disability (average of items 5 and 6) are then averaged to give you a COMI score from 0-10.
