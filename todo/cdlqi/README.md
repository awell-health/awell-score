# Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index

## Introduction
The Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) and the Cartoon CDLQI are designed to measure the impact of any skin disease on the lives of children [1].

The CDLQI consists of **10 questions** which are based on the experiences of children with skin disease.


## Scoring, validation and utility values

**The scoring of each question is:**
- Very much = 3
- Quite a lot = 2
- Only a little = 1
- Not at all = 0
- Question unanswered = 0
- Question 7: 'Prevented school' = 3

The CDLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a **maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0**. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score higher than 10 indicates that the child's life is being severely affected by their skin disease [3].

The score can be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30, but we don't recommend this, because the original score is much easier to understand.

## Sub-scales
| Section                	| Questions         	  | Score     	|
|------------------------	|-------------------	  |-----------	|
| Symptoms and feelings  	| Questions 1 and 2 	  | Maximum 6 	|
| Leisure      	          | Questions 4, 5 and 6 	| Maximum 9 	|
| School or holidays      | Question 7  	        | Maximum 3 	|
| Personal relationships  | Questions 3 and 8  	  | Maximum 6 	|
| Sleep 	                | Questions 9 	        | Maximum 3 	|
| Treatment              	| Question 10       	  | Maximum 3 	|

The scores for each of these sections can also be expressed as a percentage of either 6 or 3. For reference only: scores can indeed be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score, but it's not recommended to do this so it's not applied in our calculation.

## Scoring
The total score is simply calculated by summing all the values of the above questions.
