# Patient-Reported Outcomes version Of The Common Terminology Criteria For Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) 

## Introduction
In cancer clinical trials, adverse events (AEs) are collected and reported using the U.S. National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [1]. To improve precision and patient-centeredness in the capture of symptomatic AEs, the NCI developed a library of patient-reported outcome (PRO) items to supplement the CTCAE, called the PRO-CTCAE [2,3] Of the 790 AEs in the CTCAE, 78 were identified as amenable to patient self-report. For each of these AEs, PRO items were created reflecting the attributes of frequency, severity, interference with usual or daily activities, amount, or presence/absence. One to three attributes were selected for any given AE depending on the content of the CTCAE criteria for that AE and the nature of that particular AE. 

## Questions and Scoring

124 individual items represent the 78 symptomatic AEs currently in the PRO-CTCAE item library. There sponses are scored from 0 to 4 (or 0/1 for absent/present) and the PRO-CTCAE yields up to three patient-reported scores per symptomatic toxicity.

## Calculations

There are as yet no standardized scoring rules for how to combine attributes into a single score or how best to analyze PRO-CTCAE data longitudinally.

Therefore, Scores for each attribute (frequency, severity, interference and/or amount) of a PRO-CTCAE Symptom Term are converted to composite score based on this table: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wcM2Z8yUpAIa-pdC3_iVSkRZnNGu4rHj/view?usp=sharing. 

The composite score is then displayed for each individual PRO-CTCAE Symptom Term
