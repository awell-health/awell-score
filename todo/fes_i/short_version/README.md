# Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (Short FES-I)

## Introduction

The Short Falls Efficacy Scale International (Short FES-I) is a measure of “fear of falling” or, more properly, “concerns about falling”, which are suitable for use in research and clinical practice.

The Short FES-I was then developed by the team to allow the tool to be more applicable in clinical practice and to provide a shorter version for research. Short FES-I comprises seven questions.

## Questionnaire

[View English version of the Short FES-I questionnaire](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIqgEPJgxdqsjdVsFC-YGJRuPcSpIHNW/view?usp=sharing).

## Calculation

To obtain a total score for the Short FES-I simply add the scores on all the items together, to give a total that will range from 7 (no concern about falling) to 28 (severe concern about falling).

## Missing data

If data is missing on more than one item then a score cannot be calculated. If data is missing on no more than one of the seven items then calculate the sum score of the six items that have been completed, divide by six, and multiply by seven. The new sum score should be rounded up to the nearest whole number to give the score for an individual.
