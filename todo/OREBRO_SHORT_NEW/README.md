# 10 item Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (ÖMPSQ-10)

## Introduction

The Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (ÖMSPQ) was developed as a tool to assist in the early identification of yellow flags and patients risking the development of work disability due to the pain [1].

The ÖMSPQ has 25 items of which 21 are scored and it has satisfactory psychometric properties and predictive ability. [2] However, calls have been made for tools with the greatest clinical utility, that is, being short and easy to administer [3]. Therfore Linton et al. reported on the development and validation of a short version of the ÖMPSQ in 2011 [4].

## Questions and Scoring

The items/questions of the short version cover the following factors: self-perceived function, pain experience, distress, fear-avoidance beliefs, and return to work expectancy. Participants rate the items on 0 to 10 point scales anchored by extremes, for example, “no pain—pain as bad as it could be” or “completely disagree—completely agree.” The item on duration however, has 10 categories ranging from 0 to 1 week to more than 52 weeks.

The questions about return to work expectancy, the ability to do light work, and sleeping at night are reverse scored (10-x).

## Calculations

Te score of each item is summed up to get a total score.

## Interpretation

Scores may range from 1 to 100. Higher scores indicate higher levels of estimated risk for developing pain related disability. A total score > 49 is considered positive.
