# Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID-20) Scale

## Introduction

The Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID) scale is a well validated, psychometrically robust questionnaire with 20 items. It is sometimes referred to as the PAID-20, to distinguish it from the eleven-item (PAID-11), five-item (PAID-5), and one-item (PAID-1) short forms.

## Calculation

Respondents are asked to indicate the degree to which each of the items is currently a problem for them, from 0 (not a problem) to 4 (a serious problem). Clinically, the PAID can be used two ways:

1. Taking note of the higher scoring items and using these to start a conversation (sources of diabetes distress).
2. Calculating a total score (e.g., to assess change over time). The total score provides an indication of the severity of diabetes distress.

## Interpretation

The scores for each item are summed, then multiplied by 1.25 to generate a total score out of 100.

1. Individual items scored 3 or 4: moderate to severe distress; to be discussed during the appointment following completion of the questionnaire.
2. Total scores of 40 and above: severe diabetes distress.
