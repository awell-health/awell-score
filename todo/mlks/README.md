# Modified Lysolm Knee Score (MLKS)

The Lysholm Knee Score calculates and scores an overall score from 0 to 100 based on 8 areas: squatting, freezing, pain, stair climbing, weight bearing, instability and edema. Scores between 95 and 100 are considered exceptional, those between 84 and 94 as acceptable, those between 65 and 83 as fair, and those below 65 as poor. These values, however, are not based on validated normative data, as such data have not been examined. The Lysholm Scale, which was originally created for the assessment of knee ligament injuries, has been applied to a number of knee disorders.

## Questionnaire

The questionnaire consist of 8 questions. 

## Scoring

All scores per question are added to the total score. In the modified Lysholm system the maximum score is 100 points, in which: 
91 to 100 points is considered excellent; 
84 to 90 points good; 
65 to 83 points fair; 
64 or less points unsatisfactory.
