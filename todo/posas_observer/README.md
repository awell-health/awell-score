# POSAS Observer scale

## Introduction

The POSAS aims to measure scar quality metrics, including pigmentation, pliability, thickness, and similarity to adjacent skin architecture. It is also unique in that it combines the patient’s viewpoint of the wound with the observer’s assessment [1]. This calculation scores the observer's viewpoint.

The POSAS Observer Scale contains six items that are scored numerically on a **ten-step scale (1-10)**. Together they make up the ‘Total Score’ of the Observer Scale. Moreover, the observer can also score their ‘Overall Opinion’ but this does not count towards the 'Total Score'.

## Overview of the questionnaire

**Overview of the six items/questions that are needed for calculating the total score:**
1. Vascularity
2. Pigmentation
3. Thickness
4. Relief
5. Pliability
6. Surface area

There is one additional question which doesn't need to be taken into account for calculating the total score: the **overall opinion** of the observer".

## Total score

The total score is simply calculated by summing all the values of the above questions.
