# The Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview Short Form

## Introduction

Many instruments have been defined for assessing the amount of burden in caregivers, including the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI).

In 1980, Zarit et al. introduced the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) to evaluate the burden after a period of time of care giving for chronic patients [1,2]. The original English questionnaire included 29 items, then a version with 22-items developed in 1985 [3]. The ZBI-22 proved to be valid and reliable in many clinical settings, countries and cultures [1]. Bedard et al. in 2001 suggested a consolidated and short 12-item ZBI. They reported this 12-item ZBI is as competent as the 22-item ZBI in terms of validity and reliability [4]. Recently Higginson IJ et al. reported that Short-form of ZBI (ZBI-12) was valid in advanced conditions. It also has been translated in various languages including Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese [5-7].

The version implemented in Awell is the ZARIT-12 (=12-item version).

## Scoring

Each question is scored on a five-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (never to almost always). A higher score represents a higher feel of burden. Range of summed score is 0-48.

## Missing data
