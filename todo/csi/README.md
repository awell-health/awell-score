# Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI)

## Introduction

The CSI,developed in 2012 [1], is a two-part questionnaire that contains a survey (Part A) that assesses the frequency of health-related symptoms associated with central sensitivity syndromes (CSS) and a brief survey (Part B) asking if patients have been diagnosed with specific disorders, including seven separate CSSs [2].

## Questions and Scoring

Only Part A of the CSI is used for scoring. Participants are asked to rate each question on a 5-point scale with 0 meaning “never” and 4 meaning “always.”

Part B is not scored. 

## Calculations

A total score is obtained by adding all scores of Part A. Additionally the total score is compared to the cut-off of >=40 that helps to identfy patients with CSS 

## Interpretation
The highest possible total score is 100.

Higher CSI scores represent greater self-reported symptomology. A cutoff score of 40 or greater has shown acceptable psychometrics for identifying patients with central sensitivity syndromes [2] and has been recommended in guidelines for pain mechanism classification. [3]
