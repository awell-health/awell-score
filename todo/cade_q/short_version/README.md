# Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire – Short Version (CADE-Q SV)

## Introduction

The Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire (CADE-Q) was initially developed and psychometrically validated to assess patients’ knowledge about CAD in Brazilian CR patients. It was later translated, cross-culturally adapted, and psychometrically validated to English. It has also being used to compare knowledge between a developed and a developing country. Although both versions demonstrated good reliability and validity, a second version (CADE-Q II) was developed and validated in English in order to provide a detailed assessment of all core components of cardiac rehabilitation[1].

### CADE-Q SV 

This version was designed to be a true/false/I don’t know questionnaire, with 20 items (4 in each domain). Each correct answer equals to 1 point; therefore, the maximum score possible is 20 overall, 4 by domain, and 1 per item.

## Questions and Scoring

The 20 statements need to be answered by the respondent and every correct answered statement counts for 1 point.
