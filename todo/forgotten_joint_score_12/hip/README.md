# Forgotten Joint Score - 12 (Hip)

## Introduction

The FJS Hip was designed to assess patient outcome in patients undergoing conservative or operative treatment of the hip. This questionnaire shows its strengths in patients with a good level of hip function and a low pain level. It has been designed specifically to reduce ceiling effects commonly associated with many PRO measures in this patient group, e.g. when assessing short- to mid-term results in total hip arthroplasty patients.[1]


## Questions and Scoring

Every question is scored 1 (never) to 5 (mostly) according to the selected response categories. Thus, the raw score ranges from 12 to 60. The raw score is linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale and then reversed to obtain the final score.

## Calculation

Summing the raw scores gives you a score between 12 and 60. The raw score is linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale with the following formula `100 - (raw_score - 12)/48*100)`

## Missing data

In case of missing answers, the mean of the answered items is used instead of the sum of all items and multiplied by 12 (i.e. the missing values are replaced with the mean of the completed items).

If more than four of the answers are missing also the total score should be treated as missing.

## Interpretation

The total score ranges from 0 to 100; a high score indicates good outcome.
