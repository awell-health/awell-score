# POSAS Patient scale

## Introduction
The POSAS aims to measure scar quality metrics, including pigmentation, pliability, thickness, and similarity to adjacent skin architecture. It is also unique in that it combines the patient’s viewpoint of the wound with the observer’s assessment [1]. This calculation scores the patient's viewpoint.

The POSAS Patient Scale contains six items that are scored numerically on a **ten-step scale (1-10)**. Together they make up the ‘Total Score’ of the Patient Scale. Moreover, the patient can also score their ‘Overall Opinion’ but this does not count towards the 'Total Score'.

### Overview of the questionnaire

**Overview of the six items/questions that are needed for calculating the total score:**
1. Has the scar been **painful** the past few weeks?
2. Has the scar been **itching** the past few weeks?
3. Is the scar **color** different from the color of your normal skin at present?
4. Is the **stiffness** of the scar different from your normal skin at present?
5. Is the **thickness** of the scar different from your normal skin at present?
6. Is the scar more **irregular** than your normal skin at present?

There is one additional question which doesn't need to be taken into account for calculating the total score: "what is your **overall opinion** of the scar compared to normal skin?".

### Total score

The total score is simply calculated by summing all the values of the above questions.
