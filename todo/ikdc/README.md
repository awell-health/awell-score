# International Knee Documentation Committee - Subjective Knee (IKDC)

## Introduction

The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC Questionnaire) is a knee-specific patient-reported outcome measure. It’s considered to be one of the most reliable outcome reporting tools in its category and was one of the instruments used in the popular MOON study. IKDC has been subjected to rigorous statistical evaluation and has proven to be a valid and responsive patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) [1].

The IKDC Questionnaire is a subjective scale that provides patients with an overall function score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Meanwhile, the sports activity subscale focuses on functions like going up and down the stairs, rising from a chair, squatting and jumping. The knee function subscale asks patients one simple question: how is their knee at present versus how was their knee prior to injury?

## Scoring

### Question 2

The responses are reverse-scored such that “Constant” is assigned a score of 0 points and “Never” is assigned a score of 10 points.

### Question 3

The responses are reverse-scored such that “Worst pain imaginable” is assigned a score of 0 points and “No pain” is assigned a score of 10 points.

### Question 10

Only include the “Current function of your knee” when scoring.

### Calculate IKDC score

`(sum of all items / maximum possible score) * 100`

## Interpretation

The total score is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function.
