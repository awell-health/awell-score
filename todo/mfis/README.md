# Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)

Fatigue is an extremely common, but under-recognized, symptom in MS. In fact, 84.0% of the MSQLI Field Test sample reported fatigue as a current MS symptom. The MSQLI Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) consists of 21 items selected from the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS; Fisk, Ritvo, Ross, Haase, Murray, & Schlech, 1994), a multidimensional scale developed to assess the perceived impact of fatigue on a variety of daily activities.

## Questionnaire

The original paper-based instrument can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b-RpSDKI-pdnJTQyxP0yAcKwPDmgwKP3/view?usp=sharing).

## Scoring

The items of the MFIS can be aggregated into three subscales (Physical, Cognitive, and Psychosocial), as well as into a total MFIS score. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a patient’s activities (i.e., no items are reverse scored).

### Physical Subscale

This scale can range from 0-36. It is computed by adding raw scores on the following items: 4+6+7+10+13+14+17+20+21.

### Cognitive Subscale

This scale can range from 0-40. It is computed by adding raw scores on the following items: 1+2+3+5+11+12+15+16+18+19.

### Psychosocial Subscale

This scale can range from 0-8. It is computed by adding raw scores on the following items: 8+9

### Total MFIS Score

The Total MFIS score can range from 0-84. It is computed by adding scores on the Physical + Cognitive + Psychosocial subscales.

## Interpretation

Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a patient’s activities.
