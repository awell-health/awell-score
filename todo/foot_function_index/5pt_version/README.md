# Foot Function Index (FFI) - 5pt

## Introduction

The Foot Function Index (FFI) was developed to measure the effect of foot problems on function in terms of pain and disability. The FFI is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 scales (Limitation, Pain, and Disability). All the items are rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) and have satisfactory clinimetric properties[1].

### FFI-5pt

The original FFI instrument uses VAS scales to rate the different items. However, administration, coding, and data entry of the VAS scores are time consuming. Because of this and since several studies have shown high correlation between scores using VAS and those using verbal rating scales (VRS)12-14, the items in this version are rated on a 5 point VRS, the "FFI-5pt"[1].

## Questions and Scoring

The items of the FFI-5pt are identical to those of the FFI, but are rated on a 5 point VRS, ranging from “never” (0) to “always” (4) on the Limitation scale, “no pain” (0) to “intense pain” (4) on the Pain scale, and “no difficulty” (0) to “impossible” (4) on the Disability scale. An additional "Not applicable" option is present for every item, however.

## Calculation

**The score procedure of the FFI-5pt is identical to the original version:**
1. Discard the items that are "Not applicable", they should be omitted in further calculations
2. Calculate a score for each scale (limitation, disability & pain scale) by summing the item scores and divide that by the maximum possible sum
of the item scores. Multiply that number with 100.
3. Calculate the total score: the mean of the scale scores.

## Interpretation

The scores range from 0 to 100; the higher the score, the more limitation/pain/disability is present.
