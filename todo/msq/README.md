# Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ)

The Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) score is an essential functional medicine tool to assess patients initially and then to monitor progress. The higher the symptom score, the more severe the medical condition.

MSQ Scores give information about the body systems involved in the disease and how badly they are affected. This helps the physician to provide priority to critical systems when planning the healing process.

## Scoring

Group scores are calculated by adding all individual scores. A grand total is calculated by adding all group scores.

## Interpretation

**Based on the total score, an interpretation is added:**
- 20 or less is not clinically significant / optimal
- 20 to 49 indicates mild toxicity
- 50 to 99 indicates moderate toxicity
- 100 and above indicates severe toxicity

## Missing data

No methodology was described for handling missing data. If no answers are given, the scores for all domains and the total score will be set to 0.
