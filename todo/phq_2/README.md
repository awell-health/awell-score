# Patient Health Questionnaire‐2 (PHQ‐2)

## Introduction

The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks. The PHQ-2 includes the first two items of the PHQ-9.

The purpose of the PHQ-2 is to screen for depression in a “first-step” approach. Patients who screen positive should be further evaluated with the PHQ-9 to determine whether they meet criteria for a depressive disorder.

## Calculation

The PHQ‐2 consists of the first 2 questions of the PHQ‐9. Scores range from 0 to 6. The score is the sum of the answer values on both questions.

## Interpretation

- A PHQ-2 score ranges from 0-6. The authors identifified a score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint when using the PHQ-2 to screen for depression.
- If the score is 3 or greater, major depressive disorder is likely.
- Patients who screen positive should be further evaluated with the PHQ-9, other diagnostic instruments, or direct interview to determine whether they meet criteria for a depressive disorder.
