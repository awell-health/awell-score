# Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)

## Introduction

The Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) [1] is a widely applied self-assessment instrument for a broad range of mental disorders that assesses the subjective symptom burden in patients with mental disorders. [1,2]. 

## Questions and Scoring

The SCL-90-R assesses nine symptom dimensions: somatization, obsessive–compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. It also includes three global indices of psychological distress: Global Severity Index (number of symptoms endorsed and intensity of distress), Positive Symptom Distress Index (average level of distress for those items that were endorsed; exaggerating or attenuating response style), and Positive Symptoms Total (total symptoms endorsed/breadth of distress). Examinees rate each of 90 items on a five-point scale from 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Extremely) specifying how much each has bothered them during the past 7 days.

## Calculations

Subscores for each dimensions are calculated by adding the scores of each item belonging to a dimensions, as shown in the table:

| Dimension | Number of items | Item position in the SCL-90-R |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Somatization | 12 | 1, 4, 12, 27, 40, 42, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 58 |
| Obsessive compulsive | 10 | 3, 9, 10, 28, 38, 45, 46, 51, 55, 65 |
| Interpersonal sensitivity | 9 | 6, 21, 34, 36, 37, 41, 61, 69, 73 |
| Depression | 13 | 5, 14, 15, 20, 22, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 54, 71, 79 |
| Anxiety | 10 | 2, 17, 23, 33, 39, 57, 72, 78, 80, 86 |
| Hostility | 6 | 11, 24, 63, 67, 74, 81 |
| Phobic anxiety | 7 | 13, 25, 47, 50, 70, 75, 82 |
| Paranoid ideation | 6 | 8, 18, 43, 68, 76, 83 |
| Psychoticism | 10 | 7, 16, 35, 62, 77, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90 |
| Additional items | 7 | 19, 44, 59, 60, 64, 66, 89 |


A total score is given as a sum of all the dimensions.
