# COPD Assessment Test (CAT)

## Introduction

Quantifies impact of COPD symptoms on patients' overall health.

## Calculation

Addition of the selected points (rate each symptom on a scale of 0-5, 0 being no symptoms at all and 5 being the most severe).

## Interpretation [1]

| 11-20     | Medium        | Smoking cessation, preventive care, reduced exposure to exacerbation risk factors, and LAMA and rescue inhalers; consider ICS and/or LABA, referrals for pulmonary rehab, and possible lung transplant evaluation |
| 21-30     | High          | Smoking cessation, preventive care, reduced exposure to exacerbation risk factors, ICS/LABA/LAMA therapy, referrals for pulmonary rehab, possible lung transplant evaluation, and O₂ supplementation              |
| 31-40     | Very high     | Smoking cessation, preventive care, reduced exposure to exacerbation risk factors, ICS/LABA/LAMA therapy, referrals for pulmonary rehab, possible lung transplant evaluation, and O₂ supplementation              |
