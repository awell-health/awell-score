# Stoma â€“ Quality of Life

## Introduction

The "Stoma - QOL questionnaire" was developed to measure Quality of Life of patients with a stoma [1]. 

## Scoring

**The questionnaire consists of 20 question with the following answer options:**

| Answer option           | Answer value         
|------------------------	|-------------------
| Altijd/always  	        | 1
| Soms/Sometimes       	  | 2
| Zelden/Seldom           | 3
| Helemaal niet/not at all| 4

The total score is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a **maximum of 80 and a minimum of 20**. The lower the score, the more quality of life is impaired (a higher score thus means a higher QOL).

## Missing data

All 20 questions need to be answered in order to calculate a score.
