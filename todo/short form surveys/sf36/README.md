# Short Form 36 (SF-36)

## Introduction

The SF-36 was a product of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), a four-year study that examined specific influences on outcomes of care [1]. From the original 149-item Functional and Well Being Profile used in the MOS, Ware and Sherbourne, working with the RAND Corporation, published the SF-36 in 1992, selecting eight health domains from the forty identified in the MOS [2]. The original SF-36 underwent many changes and separate derivatives were created. In 1993, Hays, Sherbourne, and Mazel released a publicly available version of the SF-36, the RAND-36 [3].

## Questions and Scoring

The SF-36 consists of 36 items split over 8 different dimensions: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). The items and their scores can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NteojvsTPDjW_nHdxfjLw2SC3et1uBXm/view?usp=sharing

## Calculations

First, scores of each item is converted to a  0 to 100 range according to Table 1. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. 

Table 1:

| Item numbers | Original score | Coverted score |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1, 2, 20, 22, 34, 36 | 1 → | 100 |
|  | 2 → | 75 |
|  | 3 → | 50 |
|  | 4 → | 25 |
|  | 5 → | 0 |
| 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 | 1 → | 0 |
|  | 2 → | 50 |
|  | 3 → | 100 |
| 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 | 1 → | 0 |
|  | 2 → | 100 |
| 21, 23, 26, 27, 30 | 1 → | 100 |
|  | 2 → | 80 |
|  | 3 → | 60 |
|  | 4 → | 40 |
|  | 5 → | 20 |
|  | 6 → | 0 |
| 24, 25, 28, 29, 31 | 1 → | 0 |
|  | 2 → | 20 |
|  | 3 → | 40 |
|  | 4 → | 60 |
|  | 5 → | 80 |
|  | 6 → | 100 |
| 32, 33, 35 | 1 → | 0 |
|  | 2 → | 25 |
|  | 3 → | 50 |
|  | 4 → | 75 |
|  | 5 → | 100 |

Next, items in the same dimension are averaged together to create the 8 dimension scores. Table 2 lists the items averaged together.

Table 2:

| Dimension | Items to average |
| ------ | ------ |
| Physical functioning | 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 |
| Role limitations due to physical health | 13 14 15 16 |
| Role limitations due to emotional problems | 17 18 19 |
| Energy/fatigue | 23 27 29 31 |
| Emotional well-being | 24 25 26 28 30 |
| Social functioning | 20 32 |
| Pain | 21 22 |
| General health | 1 33 34 35 36 |

Items that are left blank (missing data) are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.

## Interpretation

Generally, a high score defines a more favorable health state.
