# Hip Outcome Score (HOS)

## Introduction

Originally published in 2006 in Arthroscopy, the Hip Outcome Score (HOS) was designed to assess the outcome of treatment intervention for individuals with acetabular tears who may be functioning throughout a wide range of abilities.[1] 

## Questions and Scoring

The HOS is a patient-completed measure that consists of an “Activities of Daily Living” subscale (17 scored items) and a “Sports” subscale (9 scored items) in which the response options are presented as 5-point Likert scales (Scores 0-4).

## Calculations

Each score (sub and total) is calculated in % by adding up each item score, dividing it through the maximum score of the answered items, times 100.

## Interpretation

Scores for each subscale range from 0% (least function) to 100% (most function).
