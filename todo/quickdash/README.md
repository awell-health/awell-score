# Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH)

## Introduction

The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH Outcome Measure [1]. Instead of 30 items, the QuickDASH uses 11 items to measure physical function and symptoms in persons with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. Like the DASH, the QuickDASH also has two four-item optional modules that are scored separately. 

The disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire is an upper-extremity specific outcome measure that was introduced by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in collaboration with a number of other organizations [2]. One of the main concepts behind developing the DASH was to facilitate comparisons among different upper-extremity conditions in terms of health burden [2]. The reason for using one outcome measure for different upper extremity disorders is that the upper extremity is a functional unit [3]. The QuickDASH and Dash are available in several languages under http://www.dash.iwh.on.ca

## Questions and Scoring

The QuickDASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom questions (11 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance sport/music or work section (4 items, scored 1-5). The 11 items of QuickDash address daily activities, house/yard work, shopping, recreation, self-care, eating, sleep, friends, work, pain and tingling/numbness [1].

## Calculations

The scores for all items are used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability). To calculate the QuickDASH score at least 10 items from the the disability/symptom questions must have been completed. 
For the QuickDASH score an average of the item scores is calculated, this value is then transformed to an out of 100 score by subtracting 1 and dividing it by 25.

For the optional high performance sport/music items the same calculation is performed, given that all questions were answered.

## Interpretation

A higher score indicates greater disability.
