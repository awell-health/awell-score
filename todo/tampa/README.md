# Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)

## Introduction 
The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) is a self-report measure developed to assess ‘fear of movement-related pain’ in patients with musculoskeletal pain (ie, lower back pain). The original test has been developed by Kori at al. in 1990. [1] Vlaeyen et al.[2] developed a cut-off score and reported patients that scored greater than 37 were high-responders.

## Questions and Scoring

You can find the 17 item questionnaire under the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WtxCl6R6tEdmi9KapYAEI48rEisnIr9q/view?usp=sharing

Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ‘strongly disagree’ to 4 ‘strongly agree’; total scores vary between 17 and 68, with higher scores indicating higher levels of fear of movement-related pain.

## Calculations

A total score is calculated after inversion of the individual scores of items 4, 8, 12 and 16, by adding up all scores

## Interpretation

Higher scores associate with higher levels of kinesiophobia. Patients that score greater than 37 are considerd high-responders. [2]
