# The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation

## Introduction 

The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), formerly known as the Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire (PRFEQ) [1], is a 15-item questionnaire designed to measure forearm pain and disability in patients with lateral epicondylitis (also known as “tennis elbow”)[2]. 

**The PRTEE allows patients to rate their levels of tennis elbow pain and disability from 0 to 10, and consists of 2 subscales:**
1. Pain subscale - 5 items (0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable)
2. Function subscale (0 = no difficulty, 10 = unable to do)
    - Specific activities - 6 items
    - Usual activities - 4 items 

## Questions and Scoring

The extensive user guide on how to score the PRTEE can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihCLub-U2p0o-vzAGKD-uL3o_auvunA0/view?usp=sharing).

**The PRTEE consists of 15 questions:**

| Subscale | Questions                                                  | Formula                                          |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pain     | 5 items                                                    | Sum of the 5 pain items (/50)                    |
| Function | 6 items (specific activities) + 4 items (usual activities) | Sum of the 10 function items, divided by 2 (/50) |

In addition to the individual subscale scores, a total score can be computed on a scale of 100 (0 = no disability).

## Interpretation

A higher score indicates more pain and functional disability (e.g., 0 = no disability).
