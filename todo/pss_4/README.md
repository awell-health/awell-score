# Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS-4)

## Background

The Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS-4) [1] is a shortened version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which measures an individual's perception of stress based on their subjective experiences.

## Questions and Scoring

The PSS-4 consists of a subset of questions from the PSS. The questionnaire and the original research paper can be found by following this link [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c9XZNO8u15IoFkvzDh2mgvcLNBLEI15r/view?usp=sharing)

Each question is rated on a 5-point scale, with the following response options:

- Never (0)
- Almost Never (1)
- Sometimes (2)
- Fairly Often (3)
- Very Often (4)

Question 1 and 4 in the PSS-4 are scored from 0 to 4. Questions 2 and 3 are reverse scored but reversing the scores happens by the calculation so you should assign the same values to all questions.

## Calculation

### Total score

To calculate the total score for the PSS-4, sum the ratings of all four questions. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 16.

## Interpretation

Higher scores on the PSS-4 indicate higher levels of perceived stress.
