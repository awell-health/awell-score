# VISA-A

## Introduction 

The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) serves as a disease-specific questionnaire for measurement of Achilles tendinopathy severity. The questionnaire is meant to be self-administered, uncomplicated, and relatively quick for both subjects and healthcare professionals[1,2].

## Questions and Scoring

**The VISA-A contains 8 questions about achilles tendon tendinosis:**
- 6 of 8 questions are scored on a VAS from 0-10 (10 is optimal health)
- Question 7 has 4 categories that can be scored at 0, 4, 7 or 10
- Question 8 is dependent on patientâ€™s current pain level and scored based on how long they can train
- Max score for asymptomatic individual is 100; theoretical minimum is 0
