# VISA-P

## Introduction 

The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Patella (VISA-P) is the most condition-specific patient-reported outcome measure used to assess symptom severity in athletes with patellar tendinopathy[1]. 

## Questions and Scoring

**The VISA contains 8 questions about patellar tendinosis:**
- 6 of 8 questions are scored on a VAS from 0-10 (10 is optimal health)
- Question 7 has 4 categories that can be scored at 0, 4, 7 or 10
- Question 8 is dependent on patientâ€™s current pain level and scored based on how long they can train
- Max score for asymptomatic individual is 100; theoretical minimum is 0

## Calculation

The total score is calculated by simply summing all the answers, the total score ranges between 0-100.

## Interpretation

The higher the score, the more asymptomatic (i.e. lower score = worse).
