# EQ-5D-3L

## Introduction

The 1990 introduced EQ-5D three-level version (EQ-5D-3L) is one of the most widely used instrument for measuring health-related quality of life [1]. The instrument was developed by the EuroQol group with the aim to create a generic cardinal index of health, thus giving it considerable potential for use in health care evaluation [2]. 

## Questions and Scoring

The EQ-5D-3L consists of two aspects:
1. The descriptive system
2. The visual analog scale (VAS)

The descriptive system contains 5 dimensions describing different aspects of health with 3 levels of severity. The numeric labels are used as numeric description of the health state. Thereby the EQ-5D-3L describes (3^5 =) 243 health states. 

**Dimensions:**
- Mobility
- Self-Care
- Usual activities
- Pain / Discomfort
- Anxiety / Depression

**Severity levels:**
1. no problems
2. some problems
3. extreme problems

The VAS records the patients self-rated health on a vertical VAS with a range of 0-100. The endpoints are labelled with "The best health you can imagine" (100) and "The worst health you can imagine" (0).

## Calculations

There is no calculation as such in the EQ-5D-3L, however the descriptive part of the EQ-5D-3L produces a 5-digit health state profile by putting the values of the severity levels corresponding to the dimensions in the following order: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual activities, Pain / Discomfort, Anxiety / Depression

The score for the VAS is just presented EQ VAS.

## Interpretation

The health state profile of 11111 indicates the best possible health 33333 the worst.
