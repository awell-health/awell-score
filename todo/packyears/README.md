# Packyears

## Introduction 

Standard clinical measure of quantifying smoking history.

Correlates with survival, particularly in patients with diagnosed lung cancer. In one study of patients with advanced lung cancer (stage IIIB/IV NSCLC), median overall survival was 10.8 months in patients with >15 pack year history, compared to 14.6 months in those with â‰¤15 pack year history [1].
