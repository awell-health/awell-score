# Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)

## Introduction
The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a 30-point questionnaire that's widely used test of cognitive function among the elderly [1]; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills.

## Calculation

The total score is calculated by adding all the scores resulting in a **maximum score of 30**.

**Important:**
The calculation in Awell is based on the scoring form of the MMSE. Meaning that not the whole questionnaire of the MMSE is in Awell but only the scoring form which contains a question for each category that can be scored (see table below)

| Question ID               	| Min answer 	| Max answer 	|
|---------------------------	|------------	|------------	|
| ORIENTATION_TO_TIME       	| 0          	| 5          	|
| ORIENTATION_TO_PLACE      	| 0          	| 5          	|
| REGISTRATION              	| 0          	| 3          	|
| ATTENTION_AND_CALCULATION 	| 0          	| 5          	|
| RECALL                    	| 0          	| 3          	|
| LANGUAGE                  	| 0          	| 8          	|
| CONSTRUCT                 	| 0          	| 1          	|

## Interpretations

Any score of 24 or more (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10–18 points) or mild (19–23 points) cognitive impairment. The raw score may also need to be corrected for educational attainment and age. That is, even a maximum score of 30 points can never rule out dementia. Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing [2,3]. The presence of purely physical problems can also interfere with interpretation if not properly noted; for example, a patient may be physically unable to hear or read instructions properly or may have a motor deficit that affects writing and drawing skills.
