# IBD-Control

## Introduction 

The IBD-Control is a rapid, reliable, valid and sensitive instrument for measuring overall disease control from the patient's perspective. Unlike existing patient reported outcome measures, its simplicity, ease-of-use and generic applicability make it a candidate for supporting routine care. It was developed in 2014 by Bodger et al. [1]

## Questions and Scoring

The IBD-Control instrument can be found as supplementary appendix 1 to the original publication [1] or under this following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12vXnz3uFXXzy28Hv3Z4X7bIGMSi1nSAI/view?usp=sharing

The ‘IBD-Control’ questionnaire includes five sections numbered 1 through 5. The first four sections contain a series of 13 categorical questions, each of which has three response options. Of the categorical questions, 12 items have response options of ‘Yes’, ‘No’ or ‘Not sure’ and the remaining question is a transition question for overall bowel symptoms with options of ‘Better’, ‘No change’ or ‘Worse’. The fifth section contains the horizontal VAS, anchored between zero (worst possible control) and 100 (best possible control). The time horizon for disease control assessment is the ‘past 2 weeks’. [1]

Scoring: Each response to the 13 individual items is scored as follows: zero points for least favourable reply; one point for intermediate or indeterminate reply; two points for most favourable reply. [1]

## Calculations

The IBD-Control-8 subscore is calculated by summing scores for Q1a, Q1b, Q3a, Q3b, Q3c, Q3d, Q3e and Q3f resulting in a range of 0–16 (0=worst control). 

The transition question (Q2) was excluded since this asks about change in status over 2 weeks rather than measuring current health status. The remaining questions (grouped together as items Q4a to 4d in the final questionnaire) had significant but weaker correlations with IBD-Control-VAS and/or UK-IBD-QoL and did not add significantly to performance of linear regression models predicting these measures. [1]

The IBD-Control-VAS scores are in the range 0–100 (0=worst control).
