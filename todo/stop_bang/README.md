## Introduction

The STOP-BANG score is a validated screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that consists of 8 yes/no questions. It is a simple, fast, and easy to use screening tool that can be used in the preoperative setting to identify patients at risk for OSA.

## Calculation

The score is calculated by simply summing the points of all 8 items.
