# Harris Hip Score

## Introduction

The Harris Hip Scale (HHS) was developed for the assessment of the results of hip surgery, and is intended to evaluate various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in an adult population. The original version was published 1969[1]. The HHS is an outcome measure administered by a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or a physical therapist.

## Questions and Scoring

There are ten items covering four domains. The domains are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion[2].

The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain is divided into daily activities and gait. The deformity domains observes hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy while the range of motion domain asses hip ROM.

## Calculation

### Calculate range of motion score

The range of motion score is calculated by summing the range of motion of the individual hip movements (flexion, abduction, adduction, internal & external rotation) and based on the total range of motion a corresponding score can be determined (see table below).

| Total range of motion | Corresponding score |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| [211, ...]            | 5                   |
| [161, 210]            | 4                   |
| [101, 160]            | 3                   |
| [61, 100]             | 2                   |
| [31, 60]              | 1                   |
| [0, 30]               | 0                   |

### Calculate Harris Hip Score

The total Harris Hip Score is calculated by summing:
1. Pain score
2. Function score (sum of all function related questions)
3. Deformity score: to score this section all four must be 'yes', then get 4 points. Nb. Not 1 point for each four or nothing.
4. Range of motion score (see above) 

## Interpretation

The HHS is a measure of dysfunction so the higher the score, the better the outcome for the individual. The maximum score possible is 100, the lowest possible score is 0.
