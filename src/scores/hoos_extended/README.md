# Hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS)

## Introduction 
The Hip dysfunction and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) was developed as an extension of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire, which has been used worldwide as a hip osteoarthritis (OA) specific questionnaire [1,2]. This instrument to assess the patients’ opinion about their hip and associated problems and is meant to be used over both short and long time intervals; to assess changes from week to week induced by treatment (medication, operation, physical therapy) or over years due to the primary injury or post traumatic OA. HOOS content validity was ensured through literature search, through interviews with more than 100 patients with hip disability, with and without hip OA [1] and by questioning 90 patients undergoing total hip replacement [2].

## Questions and Scoring

HOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related Quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. The possible answers are 'None' with a score of 0, 'Mild' = 1, 'Moderate' = 2, 'Severe' = 3, and 'Extreme' = 4.

## Calculations

Each subscale score is calculated independently. 

The subscale score is calculated as follows:
- Apply the mean of the observed items within the subscale (e.g. HOOS Pain), divide by 4, and multiply by 100; this number is then subtracted from 100 to get the HOOS subscale estimate for that particular cross-sectional assessment of the individual patient.

## Interpretation

100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms
