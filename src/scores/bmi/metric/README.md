# Body Mass Index (BMI)

## Introduction 
The BMI measure was conceptualized by Adolphe Quetelet in *On Man and the Development of his Faculties, or Essays on Social Physics* published in 1842. For 130 years, the BMI was largely unevaluated and unused by the research community until 1972, when Ancel Keys, a nutritional epidemiologist and physician, identified this ratio as a suitable proxy for determining body fat percentages within the population [1]. The BMI is a convenient clinical and epidemiological metric for identifying and monitoring obesity prevalence [2].

## Questions

The patient is asked to provide weight in kg and hight in cm. 

## Calculations

First, the hight is converted into m, then the BMI is calculated as follows:

```
BMI = Weight in kg / Height in m^2
```

## Interpretation

**The BMI can be catagorized as follows:**
- Severely underweight - BMI less than 16.5kg/m^2
- Underweight - BMI under 18.5 kg/m^2
- Normal weight - BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m^2
- Overweight – BMI greater than or equal to 25 to 29.9 kg/m^2
- Obesity – BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m^2

**Asian and South Asian population:**
- overweight - BMI between 23 and 24.9 kg/m^2
- obesity - BMI greater than 25 kg/m^2

Ethnicity as well as athletic status can influence the obesity risk and the catagorization based on BMI would need to be adjusted.[3]
