# The Parkinson’s Disease Questionaire-8 (PDQ-8)

## Introduction

The PDQ-8 is a short-form version, derived from the Parkinson Disease Questionaire-39 [1,2]. It is a self-administered questionnaire, used to measure quality of life in persons with Parkinson’s disease.

## PDQ-39 and the PDQ-8

A short form of the PDQ-39, the PDQ-8 has been developed using questions taken from the larger instrument to provide a single index score that is almost identical to those gained from the PDQ-39.

The PDQ-8 contains eight of the original 39 items of the PDQ-39; one item selected from each of the 8 scales. **The scales are:**
