# The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C)

## Introduction 

Various levels of physical activity participation are associated with health benefits and/or health risks. As a result, it is important that we have valid tools for assessing physical activity at various ages. This becomes particularly important with longitudinal research, which might span a number of years [1].

The PAQ-C is appropriate for elementary school-aged children (grades 4-8; approximately ages 8-14) who are currently in the school system and have recess as a regular part of their school week. 

## The instrument

The PAQ-C is a self-administered, 7-day recall instrument. It was developed to assess general levels of physical activity throughout the elementary school year for students in grades 4 to 8 and approximately 8 to 14 years of age. The PAQ-C can be administered in a classroom
setting and provides a summary physical activity score derived from nine items, each scored on a 5-point scale.

## Scoring

**Note:** Item 10 is not included in the score calculation. It can be used, however, to identify students who had unusual activity during the previous week.

### Step 1 - Calculate a composite score for item 1

Take the mean of all activities (“no” activity being a 1, “7 times or more” being a 5) on the activity checklist to form a composite score for item 1. 

### Step 2 - Calculate a composite score for items 2 to 8

The answers for each item start from the lowest activity response and progress to the highest activity response. Simply use the reported value that is checked off for each item (the lowest activity response being a 1 and the highest activity response being a 5).

### Step 3 - Calculate a composite score for item 9

Take the mean of all days of the week (“none” being a 1, “very often” being a 5) to form a composite score for item 9. 

### Step 4 - Calculate PAQ-C activity summary score

Once you have a value from 1 to 5 for each of the 9 items (items 1 to 9) used in the physical activity composite score, you simply take the mean of these 9 items, which results in the final PAQ-C activity summary score.

## Interpretation

A score of 1 indicates low physical activity, whereas a score of 5 indicates high physical activity.
