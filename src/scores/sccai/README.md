# Simple clinical colitis activity index

## Introduction 

The Simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) is a diagnostic tool and questionnaire used to assess the severity of symptoms in people who suffer from ulcerative colitis[1]. 

**The score is determined by asking the person with colitis questions regarding:**
- Bowel frequency at day/night
- Urgency of defecation
- Blood in stool
- General health
- Extracolonic manifestations
