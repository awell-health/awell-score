# The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)

The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was created to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with hip and / or knee osteoarthritis (OA).

## Scoring

The WOMAC consists of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:

1. Pain (5 items)
2. Stiffness (2 items)
3. Physical Function (17 items)

Each item is scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4). The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function.

A sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score.

## Interpretation

Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.
