# Clinical Dementia Rating

## Introduction

The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a global rating device that was first introduced in a prospective study of patients with mild “senile dementia of AD type” (SDAT) in 1982 (Hughes et al., 1982).

CDR is estimated on the basis of a semistructured interview of the subject and the caregiver (informant) and on the clinical judgment of the clinician. CDR is calculated on the basis of testing six different cognitive and behavioral domains such as memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies performance, and personal care.

## Scoring

The score given for Memory (M) is the most important and primary category. There are five secondary categories: Orientation (O), Judgement and Problem Solving (JPS), Community Affairs (CA), Home and Hobbies (HH), and Personal Care (PC).

**If the Memory score is 0:**
- The overall CDR score is 0, unless at least two secondary categories have scores of 0.5 or higher.
- If at least two secondary categories have scores of 0.5 or higher, the CDR score is 0.5.
Memory Score is 0.5:

**If the Memory score is 0.5:**
- The overall CDR score is 0.5, unless at least three secondary categories have scores of 1 or higher.
- If at least three secondary categories have scores of 1 or higher, the CDR score is 1.
Memory Score is 1 or Higher:

**If the Memory score is 1 or higher:**
- The overall CDR score cannot be 0.
- If the majority (more than half) of the secondary categories have a score of 0, the CDR score is 0.5.
- If three or more secondary categories have the same score as Memory, the CDR score is equal to the Memory score.
- If one or two secondary categories have the same score as Memory, and there are no more than two secondary categories on either side (higher or lower), the CDR score is equal to the Memory score.
- If three or more secondary categories have scores either higher or lower than the Memory score, the overall CDR score is determined by the majority:
   - If more secondary categories are higher than the Memory score, the CDR score is determined by the highest scoring secondary categories.
   - If more secondary categories are lower than the Memory score, the CDR score is determined by the lowest scoring secondary categories.
   - If there is a tie (equal numbers higher and lower), the CDR score is chosen based on the scores closest to the Memory score.

## Interpretation

The CDR is based on a scale of 0–3: no dementia (CDR = 0), questionable dementia (CDR = 0.5), MCI (CDR = 1), moderate cognitive impairment (CDR = 2), and severe cognitive impairment (CDR = 3).
