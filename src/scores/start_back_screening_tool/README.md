# STarT Back Screening Tool

## Introduction 

The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) (9-item version) is a brief validated tool, designed to screen primary care patients with low back pain for prognostic indicators that are relevant to initial decision making [1,2].

## Questions and Scoring

**The SBST has 9 questions:**

| Item | Question                                                                             | Score                                                                       |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | My back pain has spread down my leg(s) at some time in the last 2 weeks              | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 2    | I have had pain in the shoulder or neck at some time in the last 2 weeks             | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 3    | I have only walked short distances because of my back pain                           | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 4    | In the last 2 weeks, I have dressed more slowly than usual because of back pain      | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 5    | It’s not really safe for a person with a condition like mine to be physically active | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 6    | Worrying thoughts have been going through my mind a lot of the time                  | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 7    | I feel that my back pain is terrible and it’s never going to get any better          | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 8    | In general I have not enjoyed all the things I used to enjoy                         | 0 = Disagree; 1 = Agree;                                                    |
| 9    | Overall, how bothersome has your back pain been in the last 2 weeks?                 | 0 = Not at all; 1 = Slightly; 2 = Moderately; 3 = Very much; 4 = Extremely; |

### Question 9 recoding

Question 9 is recoded in the calculation:
- Not at all = 0
- Slightly = 0
- Moderately = 0
- Very much = 1
- Extremely = 1

## Calculation

**The SBST calculation in Awell yields 3 results:**
1. Total score
2. Subscale score
3. Risk classification (low, medium or high)

### Total score

Total score is produced by summing positive items (items 1–9).

### Subscale score

The psychosocial subscale score is a sum of bothersomeness, fear, catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression items (items 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).

### Risk classification

The SBST produces two scores: total score and distress (psychosocial) subscale. These are used to stratify patients into low, medium and high risk groups which have their respective matched treatment packages.

[Risk classification can be done by following this algorithm.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4KdfcDY_npOx0gE_FzBJqk-q7Q83lcz/view?usp=sharing)

## Interpretation

| Scores                      | Result      | Interpretation                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Total score                 | Score on /9 | A higher score means more complaints          |
| Psychosocial subscale score | Score on /5 | A higher score means more complaints          |
| Risk classification         | 1, 2 or 3   | 1 = Low risk; 2 = Medium risk; 3 = High risk; |
