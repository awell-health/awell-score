# Acromegaly Quality of Life Questionnaire (AcroQoL)

AcroQoL is a self-administered disease specific questionnaire to measure quality of life in patients with acromegaly. It contains 22 items divided in two scales that measure physical and psychological aspects. The validation process demonstrated the questionnaire to have high internal consistency, reliability and responsiveness to change, therefore is a useful tool to be used in clinical trials as well as in the monitoring of patients in the clinical practice.

## Questionnaire

The questionnaire is uni-dimensional and contains 22 items divided in two scales: one that evaluates physical aspects (eight items) and another one that evaluates psychological aspects (14 items). This last one is also divided in two sub-scales: one of them that evaluates physical appearance, and another one that evaluates the impact of the disease on the personal relationships of the patient (seven items each).

AcroQoL is a self administered questionnaire. It takes about five minutes to answer the questionnaire.

## Scoring

Each of the 22 items of the AcroQoL is answered in a 1 to 5 Likert scale measuring either the frequency of occurrence (always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never) or the degree of agreement with the items (completely agree, moderately agree, neither agree nor disagree, moderately disagree, completely disagree). 

A global score and scores of the respective scales and subscales are obtained by completing the results using the following formula: ((XKY)/(5YKY)) x 100 where X is the sum of the answers (between 1 and 5 for each item) of the respective scale and Y is the number of items of the respective scale. The formula converts the different scores to a scale between a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100, where a higher score indicates a better QoL.

## Application

AcroQoL is a simple and valid specific instrument to assess HRQOL in people suffering acromegaly aged 18 to 70 years. It can be used in two different fields: in clinical trials of new drugs, and in the monitoring of patients in clinical practice. This is to assess patients' self-perceived status as well as to be used as an instrument to screen patients who require appropriate further evaluation due to its good responsiveness to change. The longitudinal assessment of HRQOL of patients suffering acromegaly will increase the knowledge of the impact of the disease on patient perception of well-being and functioning. This is particularly useful in the evaluation of intervention or treatment effects.

AcroQoL, as a disease-specific questionnaire, evaluates those dimensions that have been described to specifically affect to patients with acromegaly, therefore it detects morbidity that could be missed by generic tools. Nevertheless when the aim is to evaluate new interventions it's desirable to use AcroQoL together with a generic questionnaire, in order to cover new dimensions of quality of life that haven't been described as important in the acromegalic patients.
