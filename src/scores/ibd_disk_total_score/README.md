# IBD-Disk

## Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] are disabling disorders. The IBD-Disability Index [IBD-DI] was developed for quantifying disability in IBD patients but is difficult to use. [1,2] The IBD Disk was developed using a consensus-based process to select elements from the IBD-DI that are most likely to be important in assessing a patient's disease burden and had relevance to both the patient and physician. [3] Several items (difficulties with work/education and feeling depressed/anxious) were combined owing to similarities in concept. In addition, the IBD CONNECT Steering Committee included “sexual functions” from the ICF comprehensive core set. The Working Group later also agreed to include “joint pain,” from the IBD-DI and ICF core set. The final IBD Disk included 10 items. Validations of the IBD DISK are currently ongoing. [4] 

## Questions and Scoring

The IBD-Disk consists of 10 questions,   exploring   abdominal   pain,   defecation,   social   life, professional life, sleep, energy, anxiety, self image, sexual functions (private life), and joint pain. Each answer is marked on a 11-point visual analog scale, from 0 to 10, 0 corresponding to “absolutely not” (no complaint) and 10 to “definitely yes” (maximal complaint). 

## Calculations

A total score is calculated by summing up all individual scores.

## Interpretation

Total score ranges from 0 (=no complaints) to 100 (=maximal complaints).
