# Oswestry Disability Index

## Introduction 

The Oswestry Disability Index is patient-completed questionnaire which gives a subjective percentage score of level of function (disability) in activities of daily living in those rehabilitating from low back pain[1].

## Questions and Scoring

The ODI has 10 questions. Each question is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. The total raw score is calculated by summing all the items, which results in a maximum score of 50. The raw score is, however, usually expressed as a percentage.

### Missing data

If one question is not answered or not applicable the score is calculated as follows:
```
(sum of all 9 answer values / max score of all 9 answer values) * 100
```

The max total score when one question is missing is 45. So it'll be `(sum of all answers / 45) * 100`

When more than one response is missing (i.e. less than 9 questions answered), a score cannot be calculated.

## Calculation

- Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. 
- Points summed to a total score.
- The raw score is then expressed as a percentage on 100.

## Interpretation

| Score                          | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0% to 20%: minimal disability: | The patient can cope with most living activities. Usually no treatment is indicated apart from advice on lifting sitting and exercise.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 21%-40%: moderate disability:  | The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and standing. Travel and social life are more difficult and they may be disabled from work. Personal care, sexual activity and sleeping are not grossly affected and the patient can usually be managed by conservative means. |
| 41%-60%: severe disability     | Pain remains the main problem in this group but activities of daily living are affected. These patients require a detailed investigation.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 61%-80%: crippled:             | Back pain impinges on all aspects of the patient's life. Positive intervention is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
