# Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) - Adult Version (AQ-50)

## Introduction

The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a self-administered instrument for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. The AQ-50 is designed for adults aged 16 years and older.

## Calculation

Only 1 point can be scored for each question. Possible answers are "Definitely Agree", "Slightly Agree", "Slightly Disagree" and "Definitely Disagree".

**Questions where "Definitely Agree" or "Slightly Agree" score 1 point:**
Questions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 33, 35, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46

**Questions where "Slightly Disagree" or "Definitely Disagree" score 1 point:**
Questions 1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 44, 47, 48, 49, 50

Total AQ-50 scores range from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating more autistic traits.

## Interpretation

For the AQ-50, two previously described cut-offs have been studied:
- **Screening cut-off: ≥26** - Used for broader screening purposes
- **Clinical threshold: ≥32** - Used for clinical assessment

These thresholds are from Baron-Cohen et al. (2001), where adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), and 80% scored 32+, versus only 2% of controls.

Note: The AQ-50 is a screening tool and should not be used as a sole diagnostic instrument. Referral to a specialist for comprehensive diagnostic assessment is recommended for individuals scoring above the thresholds.
