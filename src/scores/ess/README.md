# The Epworth Sleepiness Scale

## Introduction 

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most people engage in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day.  The ESS for adults was developed in 1990 [1] and subsequently slightly modified in 1997 [2,3].

## Questions and Scoring

The ESS has 8 questions which are all scored on a 0-3 scale:
- 0 = would never doze
- 1 = slight chance of dozing
- 2 = moderate chance of dozing
- 3 = high chance of dozing

| Item | Question                                                        |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Sitting and reading                                             |
| 2    | Watching TV                                                     |
| 3    | Sitting, inactive in a public place (e.g. a theatre or meeting) |
| 4    | As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break             |
| 5    | Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit   |
| 6    | Sitting and taling to someone                                   |
| 7    | Sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol                   |
| 8    | In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in the traffic        |

## Calculation

The ESS score is produced by taking the sum of the 8 items (scored 0-3). The total score can thus range from 0 to 24.

## Interpretation

The higher the ESS score, the higher that person’s average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their ‘daytime sleepiness’.

**In general ESS scores can be interpreted as follows:**

| Score range | Interpretation                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| [0,5]       | Lower Normal Daytime Sleepiness       |
| [6,0]       | Higher Normal Daytime Sleepiness      |
| [11,12]     | Mild Excessive Daytime Sleepiness     |
| [13,15]     | Moderate Excessive Daytime Sleepiness |
| [16,24]     | Severe Excessive Daytime Sleepiness   |
