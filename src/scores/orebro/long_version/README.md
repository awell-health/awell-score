# Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (ÖMPQ)

## Introduction 

The Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (ÖMPQ) is a ‘yellow flag’ screening tool that predicts long-term disability and failure to return to work when completed four to 12 weeks following a soft tissue injury[1]. A cut-off score of 105 has been found to predict those who will recover (with 95 per cent accuracy), those who will have no further sick leave in the next six months (with 81 per cent accuracy), and those who will have long-term sick leave (with 67 per cent accuracy)[2].

The ÖMPQ predicted failure to return to work six months after compensable musculoskeletal injury in a NSW population of workers. The injuries in the study group were mixed, and the ÖMPQ was found to be more specific and sensitive for back injuries. In workers with back injuries screened at four to 12 weeks, a cut-off score of 130 correctly predicted 86 per cent of those who failed to return to work[3].

Identification, through the ÖMPQ, of workers at risk of failing to return to work due to personal and environmental factors provides the opportunity for treating practitioners to apply appropriate interventions (including the use of activity programs based on cognitive behavioural strategies) to reduce the risk of long-term disability in injured workers. Evidence indicates that these factors can be changed if they are addressed[4].

## Missing data

All questions should be answered, as missing values will reduce validity[5].

## Calculations

- For question 5, count the number of pain sites and multiply by two – this is the score (maximum score allowable is 10).
- For questions 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 and 20 the score is the number that has been ticked or circled.
- For questions 12, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 the score is 10 minus the number that has been circled.

Add up the scores for questions 5 to 25 – this is the total ÖMPQ score.

## Interpretation

A cut-off score of 105 has been found to predict those who will recover (with 95 per cent accuracy), those who will have no further sick leave in the next six months (with 81 per cent accuracy), and those who will have long-term sick leave (with 67 per cent accuracy)[2].
