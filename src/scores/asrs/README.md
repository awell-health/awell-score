# Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS)

The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS v1.1) is an 18-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in adults (18+). This scale is based on the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (2001), and the questions are consistent with DSM criteria, but reworded to better reflect symptom manifestation in adults. This scale is useful for screening and diagnosis of ADHD among adults 18+ and should be used in conjunction with a clinical interview to provide additional clinical information.

## Questionnaire

## Parts & subscales

### Parts

**Part A - items 1-6:**
If the respondent scores 4 or more in Part-A, then the symptom profile of the individual is considered to be highly consistent with an ADHD diagnosis in adults (Adler et al., 2006; Kessler et al., 2007).

**Part B - items 7-18:**
The frequency scores on Part B provide additional cues and can serve as further probes into the patient’s symptom severity and the impact that inattention or hyperactivity has on their life.

**Total Score:**
Sum of part A and B

### Subscales

Stanton, Forbes and Zimmerman (2018) determined, by using CFA with over 1,000 adult subjects, that the ASRS had three factors:
1. Inattentive subscale: items 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
2. Motor Hyperactive/Impulsive subscale: items 5, 6, 12, 13, 14
3. Verbal Hyperactive/Impulsive subscale: items 15, 16, 17, 18

These factors are used to compute subscale scores. It is noted that the DSM specifies two subtypes (Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive) however analysis of this scale indicates three distinct symptom clusters.

## Scoring

Depending on the question, responses are either scored as 0 or 1. On items 1-3, 9, 12, 16, and 18 ratings of sometimes, often, or very often are assigned one point (ratings of never or rarely are assigned zero points). For the remaining 11 items, ratings of often or very often are assigned one point (ratings of never, rarely, or sometimes are assigned zero points).


## Interpretation

For a client’s symptoms to be considered consistent with an ADHD diagnosis, they require 4 or more responses at specific severity levels in Part A of the ASRS.
