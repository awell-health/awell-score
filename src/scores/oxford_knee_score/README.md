# Oxford Knee Score

## Introduction 

The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a 12-item patient-reported PRO specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery (arthroplasty). It is short, reproducible, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes[1].

## Questions and Scoring

When the OKS was originally developed, it was designed to be as simple as possible in order to promote use. The original scoring system was a 1-5 where one represented the best outcome[2]. However, clinicians found this confusing in practice and adaptations began to appear so the original authors developed a new scoring system from 0-4 where four is the best outcome and total scores range from 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome)[2].

**Awell only supports the 0 to 4 scoring system.**

## Calculation

The total score is produced by taking the sum of all the 12 items (scored 0-4 or 1-5). The total score can thus range from 0 to 48 (or 12 to 60).

### Missing data

If there are more than two missing answers, it is recommended that the overall score should not be calculated. In the event one or two questions are unanswered, it is recommended that clinicians put in a mean answer from the patient's other answer. If a question has more than one answer, the worst response i.e. smallest number is used for calculations[2].

> This behaviour is currently not implemented in our calculation.

## Interpretation

Total scores ranges from 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).

| [0,19]      | May indicate severe knee arthritis. It is highly likely that you may well require some form of surgical intervention, contact your family physician for a consult with an Orthopaedic Surgeon.                                             |
| [20,29]     | May indicate moderate to severe knee arthritis. See your family physician for an assessment and x-ray. Consider a consult with an Orthopaedic Surgeon.                                                                                     |
| [30,39]     | May indicate mild to moderate knee arthritis. Consider seeing your family physician for an assessment and possible x-ray. You may benefit from non-surgical treatment, such as exercise, weight loss, and /or anti-inflammatory medication |
| [40,48]     | May indicate satisfactory joint function. May not require any formal treatment.                                                                                                                                                            |
