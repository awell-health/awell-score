# CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk

## Introduction

CHA2DS2-VASc score (Birmingham 2009) was developed after identifying additional stroke risk factors in patients with atrial fibrillation.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is one of several risk stratification schema that can help determine the 1 year risk of a TE event in a non-anticoagulated patient with non-valvular AF. The CHA2DS2-VASc score, among other risk stratification schema, can be used to provide an idea of a patient’s risk for TE event.

## Calculation

The score is calculated by simply summing the points of all 7 items.

## Interpretation [1]

| CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score | Risk of ischemic stroke | Risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0                  | 0.2%                    | 0.3%                                 |
| 1                  | 0.6%                    | 0.9%                                 |
| 2                  | 2.2%                    | 2.9%                                 |
| 3                  | 3.2%                    | 4.6%                                 |
| 4                  | 4.8%                    | 6.7%                                 |
| 5                  | 7.2%                    | 10.0%                                |
| 6                  | 9.7%                    | 13.6%                                |
| 7                  | 11.2%                   | 15.7%                                |
| 8                  | 10.8%                   | 15.2%                                |
| 9                  | 12.2%                   | 17.4%                                |
