# SNAP-IV 26-Item Parent Rating Scale (SNAP)

## Introduction

The SNAP-IV 26-item scale is an abbreviated version of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP) Questionnaire (Swanson, 1992; Swanson et al., 1983). Items from the DSM-IV criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are included for the two subsets of symptoms: Inattention (items 1–9) and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (items 10–18). Also, items from the DSM-IV criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are included (items 19–26) because ODD is often present in children with ADHD. The scale can be used by the parents and teacher of children and adolescents between the ages of 8 to 18.

## Calculation

This is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the response categories, respectively, of “Not at all”, “Just a little”, “Quite a bit”, and “Very much”. 
SNAP is divided into three Subsets: 
Questions 1 – 9: Inattention Subset
Questions 10 – 18: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Subset
Questions 19 – 26: Opposition/Defiance Subset

The scores in each of the three subsets (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and
opposition/defiance) are totalled.

## Interpretation

Questions 1 – 9: Inattention Subset
< 13 = Symptoms not clinically significant
13 – 17 = Mild symptoms
18 – 22 = Moderate symptoms
23 – 27 = Severe symptoms

Questions 10 – 18: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Subset
<13 = Symptoms not clinically significant
13 – 17 = Mild symptoms
18 – 22 = Moderate symptoms
23 – 27 = Severe symptoms

Questions 19 – 26: Opposition/Defiance Subset
< 8 = Symptoms not clinically significant
8 – 13 = Mild symptoms
14 – 18 = Moderate symptoms
19 – 24 = Severe symptoms

Suggested Targets:
<13/27 for inattention
<13/27 for hyperactivity/impulsivity
<8/24 for oppositional defiant disorder

If desired, the average rating for each subset can be calculated by totalling the scores for
the items in the subset and dividing by the number of items. The average can be compared
with cut-off scores suggestive of ADHD reported in the literature. 

## Comparison of Parent and Teacher Results in Awell

In the Awell platform, the SNAP-IV 26-item scale is structured into the same three subsets—Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, and Opposition/Defiance—for both parent and teacher assessments. This uniform format allows for a straightforward comparison of scores between parent and teacher observations, ensuring that insights from both perspectives can be evaluated consistently.
