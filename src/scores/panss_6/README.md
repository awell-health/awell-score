# Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-6)

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. It was published in 1987 by Stanley Kay, Lewis Opler, and Abraham Fiszbein. It is widely used in the study of antipsychotic therapy. The scale is known as the "gold standard" that all assessments of psychotic behavioral disorders should follow.[1]

The name refers to the two types of symptoms in schizophrenia, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association: positive symptoms, which refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), and negative symptoms, which represent a diminution or loss of normal functions. Some of these functions which may be lost include normal thoughts, actions, ability to tell fantasies from reality, and the ability to properly express emotions.[2]

## PANNS-6 [3]

It was recently demonstrated in acutely exacerbated schizophrenia that a 6-item version (PANSS-6) of the 30-item Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-30) was scalable (all items provide unique information regarding syndrome severity) and able to separate the effect of antipsychotics from placebo. Here, we tested the validity and sensitivity of PANSS-6 in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) outpatient study.

**The 6 items of the PANSS-6 are:**
1. P1 = delusions
2. P2 = conceptual disorganization
3. P3 = hallucinations
4. N1 = blunted affect
5. N4 = social withdrawal
6. N6 = lack of spontaneity/flow of conversation

## Scoring

PANSS items are rated on a 7-point scale (1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, and 7=extreme); because the absence of symptoms is equal to 1 point, the lowest possible total score is 6.

**Three scores are calculated:**
1. Total score: sum of all individual item scores
2. Positive scale score: sum of all positive item scores (P1,P2, and P3)
3. Negative scale score: sum of all negative item scores (N1,N4, and N6)
