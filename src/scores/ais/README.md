# Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS)

## Introduction

The Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS) is a psychological assessment tool designed to measure the degree to which individuals accept their illness. Originally developed by B.J. Felton, T.A. Revenson, and G.A. Hinrichsen in 1984, the AIS has been widely used in research and clinical practice to evaluate how patients adapt to chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and other conditions.

## Questions (8)

The AIS consists of 8 statements describing negative consequences of poor health, including:

1. **Adjustment difficulties**: Problems adapting to illness limitations
2. **Activity restrictions**: Inability to engage in preferred activities
3. **Self-worth issues**: Feelings of being unnecessary or burdensome
4. **Dependency concerns**: Increased reliance on others
5. **Social impact**: Concerns about others' reactions to the illness

## Scoring

### Response Scale
Each question uses a 5-point Likert scale:
- **1**: Definitely agree (poor acceptance)
- **2**: Agree
- **3**: Do not know
- **4**: Do not agree
- **5**: Definitely disagree (good acceptance)

### Total Score
- **Range**: 8-40 points
- **Calculation**: Sum of all 8 responses
- **Higher scores** = Better acceptance of illness
- **Lower scores** = Poorer acceptance of illness

## Interpretation

The AIS score is interpreted using three categories based on research literature:

| Score Range | Interpretation | Description |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| 8-19 points | **Low acceptance** | Poor adaptation to illness, significant psychological discomfort |
| 20-30 points | **Moderate acceptance** | Average level of illness acceptance |
| 31-40 points | **High acceptance** | Good adaptation to illness, minimal negative emotions |

## Clinical Applications

The AIS is valuable for:

- **Treatment planning**: Identifying patients who may benefit from psychological support
- **Progress monitoring**: Tracking changes in illness acceptance over time
- **Research**: Studying factors that influence adaptation to chronic illness
- **Quality of life assessment**: Understanding the emotional impact of illness

## Psychometric Properties

The AIS demonstrates:
- **Good reliability**: Cronbach's alpha = 0.82-0.85
- **Test-retest reliability**: r = 0.69 over 7 months
- **Construct validity**: Significant correlations with quality of life measures
- **Clinical utility**: Discriminates between different patient groups

## Implementation Notes

### Missing Data
- If responses are missing, they contribute 0 to the total score
- Consider requiring complete responses for valid interpretation
- Partial responses may underestimate acceptance levels

### Clinical Considerations
- Low scores may indicate need for psychological intervention
- Consider cultural factors when interpreting results
- Use alongside other quality of life measures for comprehensive assessment

### Research Applications
- Suitable for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies
- Can be used to evaluate intervention effectiveness
- Validated in multiple languages and populations
