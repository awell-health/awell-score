# Catalight Family Wellbeing Scale (CFWS)

Catalight believes a key to treatment success is prioritizing quality of life to ensure the client and their family are thriving.

Leveraging one of the largest collections of real-world clinical data focused on developmental disabilities, The Parental Stress Scale, originally developed by Berry and Jones in 1995 were adapted by Catalight researchers for the I/DD population by reducing the number of questions to achieve an effective measure of parental stress.

The 15-question self-assessment takes just minutes to complete and evaluates parental stress. Results provide indicators for stress ranging from average, moderate or clinically significant. The other key element of measuring parental stress is it leads to effective and accurate interventions, delivering positive outcomes for the entire family.

## Questionnaire

There are 15 questions which are statements that are rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

## Scoring

The sum of all the scores is used to calculate the CFWS score. The score is then used to determine an interpretation or category:

- Average: > 52
- Little lower: 43-51
- Lot lower: < 43
