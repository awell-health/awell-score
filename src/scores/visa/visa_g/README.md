# VISA-G

## Introduction 

The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G) is a reliable and valid disability score for gluteal tendinopathy [1].

## Questions and Scoring

**The VISA-G contains 8 questions about gluteal tendinopathy:**
- Question 1 is scored on a VAS from 0-10 (10 is optimal health)
- Questions 2-6 have 5 categories that can be scored at 0, 2, 5, 7 or 10
- Question 7 has 4 categories that can be scored at 0, 4, 7 or 10
- Question 8 is dependent on patientâ€™s current pain level and scored based on how long they can train
- Max score for asymptomatic individual is 100; theoretical minimum is 0

## Calculation

The total score is calculated by simply summing all the answers, the total score ranges between 0-100.

## Interpretation

The higher the score, the more asymptomatic (i.e. lower score = worse).
