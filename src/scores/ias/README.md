# Illness Attitudes Scale (IAS)

## Introduction 

The Illness Attitudes Scale (IAS) is a self-rated measure that consists of nine subscales designed to assess fears, attitudes and beliefs associated with hypochondriacal concerns and abnormal illness behavior [1]. In the original list 9 subscales were distinguished. Subsequent validation studies lead to two subscales: disease anxiety and disease behavior [2,3] 

## Questions and Scoring

The IAS has 29 questions, most of them multiple choice questions scored from (0,4). The open ended questions are not used for the score calculation but can provide extra information for the health care professionals.

All items are scored from (0,4) and per subscale we take the sum of all the items in that subscale.

## Interpretation

A higher score represent more severe ilness attitudes.
