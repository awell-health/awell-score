# The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)

The HAQ was developed as a comprehensive measure of outcome in patients with a wide variety of rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, and psoriatic arthritis. It has also been applied to patients with HIV/AIDS and in studies of normal aging. It should be considered a generic rather than a disease-specific instrument. Its focus is on self-reported patient-oriented outcome measures, rather than process measures. 

## Questionnaire

**There are 8 sections:**

1. dressing
2. arising
3. eating
4. walking
5. hygiene
6. reach
7. grip
8. activities

There are 2 or 3 questions for each section. Scoring within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). 

## Scoring

For each section the score given to that section is the worst score within the section, i.e. if one question is scored 1 and another 2, then the score for the section is 2. 

In addition, if an aide or device is used or if help is required from another individual, then the minimum score for that section is 2. If the section score is already 2 or more then no modification is made. 

### Disability index

The 8 scores of the 8 sections are summed and divided by 8. The result is the DI or FDI, the disability index or functional disability index. In the event that one section is not completed by a subject then the summed score would be divided by 7.
