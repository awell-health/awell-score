# KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score)

## Introduction 

The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a comprehensive questionnaire designed to assess both short and long-term patient-relevant outcomes following knee injury. The KOOS is self-administered and assesses five separate patient-relevant dimensions: 

1. Pain (9 items), 
2. Symptoms (7 items), 
3. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Function (17 items), 
4. Sport and Recreation Function (5 items), 
5. Knee-related Quality of Life (4 items). 

The questionnaire takes approximately 10 minutes to complete [1].

## Questions and Scoring

**Each item is scored from 0 to 4:**

- 0 = No problems
- 1 = Mild problems
- 2 = Moderate problems
- 3 = Severe problems
- 4 = Extreme problems

### Missing data

At least 50% of the items in each subscale should be responded to. If this is not the case, the score for that subscale cannot be calculated.

## Calculation

Each subscale score is calculated independently. Calculate the mean score of the individual items of each subscale and divide by 4 (the highest possible score for a single answer option). 

Traditionally in orthopedics, 100 indicates no problems and 0 indicates extreme problems. The normalized score is transformed to meet this standard.

Formula: `100-meanSubscaleScore/4*100`

## Interpretation

0 represents extreme knee problems and 100 represents no knee problems.
