# 10 Metre Walk Test (TMWT)

## Introduction

The 10 Metre Walk Test is a performance measure used to assess walking speed in meters per second over a short distance. It can be employed to determine functional mobility, gait, and vestibular function.

## Method of use

An individual is asked to walk 10 meters, usually indicated by 2 lines (start and an end point). A stopwatch is used to measure how long it took the patient to cover the 10m distance (in seconds). **Three trials** are allowed.

## Calculation

**Based on all the trial results we can calculate:**
1. Mean in seconds = `mean of all trial results in seconds`
2. Mean in seconds per meter = `total distance covered / total time in seconds`
3. Mean in kilometers per hour = `mean in seconds per meter * 3.6`

### Example

If you did a 10-meter gait speed test and it took you 7 seconds, the equation would be: 10 meters / 7 seconds = 1.4 meters per second[1]. This is equal to 5.04 kilometers/per hour.
