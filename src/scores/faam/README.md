# Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)

## Introduction

The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) is a self-report outcome instrument developed to assess physical function for individuals with foot and ankle related impairments.[1]

## Questions and Scoring

Originally published in 2005 in Foot and Ankle International, the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) was developed to assess the physical function of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders of the leg, foot, and ankle.

The FAAM is a patient-completed instrument that consists of an “Activities of Daily Living” subscale (21 scored items) and a “Sports” subscale (7 scored items) in which the response options are presented as 5-point Likert scales (range 4 to 0). Scores for each subscale range from 0% (least function) to 100% (most function).

The FAAM questionnaire has three questions that are not included in the score calculation:

1. "How would you rate your current level of function during you usual activities of daily living from 0 to 100 with 100 being your level of function prior to your foot or ankle problem and 0 being the inability to perform any of your usual daily activities."
2. "How would you rate your current level of function during your sports related activities from 0 to 100 with 100 being your level of function prior to your foot or ankle problem and 0 being the inability to perform any of your usual daily activities?"
3. "Overall, how would you rate your current level of function?"

## Calculations

In order to score ADL and Sports subscale 20/21 items and 6/7 items must be completed, respectively. N/A responses are not counted in score calculation.

Each subscore score (FAAM ADL and FAAM Sports) is calculated in % by adding up each item score, dividing it through the maximum score of the answered items, times 100.

## Interpretation

Higher scores represent higher levels of function for each subscale, with 100% representing no dysfunction.
