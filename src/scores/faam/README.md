# Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)

## Introduction

The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) is a self-report outcome instrument developed to assess physical function for individuals with foot and ankle related impairments.[1]

## Questions and Scoring

The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure is a 29-item questionnaire divided into two subscales: the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, 21-item 
Activities of Daily Living Subscale and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, 8-item Sports Subscale. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (4 to 0) from ‘no difficulty at all’ to ‘unable to do’.

## Calculations

In order to score ADL and Sports subscale 20/21 items and 6/7 items must be completed, respectively. N/A responses are not counted in score calculation.

Each subscore score (FAMM ADL and FAMM Sports) is calculated in % by adding up each item score, dividing it through the maximum score of the answered items, times 100.

## Interpretation
Higher scores represent higher levels of function for each subscale, with 100% representing no dysfunction.
