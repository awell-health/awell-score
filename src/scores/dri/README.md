# Disability Rating Index (DRI)

## Introduction

The Disability Rating Index (DRI) is a patient-reported outcome measure developed by Salén et al. in 1994 [1], with the aim of measuring physical disability of respondents within a clinical setting. The DRI evaluates a respondent’s disability by assessing activity and participation limitations.

## Questions and Scoring
The DRI is a questionnaire covering 12 items concerning physical function only arranged as a visual analogue scale (VAS):
1. dressing (without help);
2. outdoor walks;
3. climbing stairs;
4. sitting for a longer time;
5. standing bent over a sink;
6. carrying a bag;
7. making a bed;
8. running;
9. light work;
10. heavy work;
11. lifting heavy objects;
12. participating in exercise/sports. 

The anchor points are without difficulty = 0 and not at all = 100. The 12 items are divided into three sections: 1-4, common basic activities of daily life; 5-8, more demanding daily physical activities; 9-12,work-related or more vigorous activities. 

## Calculations

The mean of the 12 items provides the DRI. 

## Interpretation

DRI equal or bigger than 50 % are considered a positive score.
