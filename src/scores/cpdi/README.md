## COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI)
## Introduction
The CPDI is an index of 24 questions designed to capture the frequency of specific phobias and stress disorders relevant to Covid-19, including anxiety, depression, specific phobias, cognitive change, avoidance and compulsive behavior, physical symptoms and loss of social functioning [1,2]. CPDI ranges from 0 to 100.

## Scoring
**24 items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (‘not at all’) to 4 (‘extremely’).** The total score ranges from 0 to 100 (=raw score / total score). A score below 28 indicates no distress, between 28 and 51 mild to moderate distress, and above 51 severe distress 8 .
