# Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)

The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a validated instrument to assess the degree of functional limitation in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis.

## Scoring

The BASFI score consists of the sum of the user answers which are physically plotted on a visual analogue scale or selected on a scale between 0 and 10. The patient is asked to think of what they experience during activities such as getting dressed, standing up or climbing up the stairs.

The activities are rated from 0, which means no impairment, to 10, which means severe impairment.

## Interpretation

There is no specified cut off point, however, the higher the score, the higher the functional impairment caused by ankylosing spondylitis.
