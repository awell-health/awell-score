# Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)

The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a brief instrument that was designed to assess the severity of both nighttime and daytime components of insomnia.

It is is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The usual recall period is the “last month” and the dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. 

## Scoring

A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem).

The Insomnia Severity Index has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28.

## Interpretation

| Score | Interpretation                        |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| 0-7   | No clinically significant insomnia    |
| 8-14  | Subthreshold insomnia                 |
| 15-21 | Clinical insomnia (moderate severity) |
| 22-28 | Clinical insomnia (severe)            |

## Missing data

A score is only calculated when all 7 items have an answer.
