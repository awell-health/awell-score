# Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI).

## Introduction

The Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) is an easily accessible, reliable and valid self-report questionnaire that measures the impact of pain on an individual’s life, how others respond to that person’s expression of pain and the frequency at which the individual engages in specific activities of daily life [1]. Evidence-based and consensus reviews of the MPI [2,3] have recommended this instrument for the assessment of individuals suffering from chronic pain and as a core outcome measure within clinical trials.

## Questions and Scoring

The MPI is composed of 52 items across twelve subscales and three overall domains. Patient’s responses to MPI items are made on a 7-point scale, each item is scored 0-6.

### Domain 1 - Pain experience (5 subscales)

Part I includes five scales designed to measure important dimensions of the chronic pain experience including; 1) perceived interference of pain in vocational, social/recreational, and family/marital functioning, 2) support or concern from spouse or significant other, 3) pain severity, 4) perceived life control, and 5) affective distress. 

### Domain 2 - Response of others to the patient's communicated pain (3 subscales)

Part II assesses patients’ perceptions of the degree to which spouses or significant others display Solicitous, Distracting or Negative responses to their pain behaviors and complaints. 

### Domain 3 - Participation in dailiy activities (4 subscales)

Part III assesses patients’ report of the frequency with which they engage in four categories of common everyday activities; Household Chores, Outdoor Work, Activities Away from Home, and Social Activities.

## Calculations

**Important note:**
The calculation in Awell only calculates the 3 domains and a total score. Scoring for the individual subscales per domain is not perfomed.

The domain scores are the sum of all items within that domain. In addition to the individual scale scores, a total score is obtained from the addition of all subscales.
