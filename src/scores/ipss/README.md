# International Prostate Symptom Index

## Introduction

The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) can be utilized to measure the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms. It is a validated, reproducible scoring system to assess disease severity and response to therapy.

The IPSS is made up of 7 questions related to voiding symptoms. A score of 0 to 7 indicates mild symptoms, 8 to 19 indicates moderate symptoms and 20 to 35 indicates severe symptoms.

It is not a reliable diagnostic tool for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of BPH, but can be used to quantitatively measure LUTS after a diagnosis is made.

The IPSS isn't adequate for ruling in or ruling out the diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction. In the JAMA Rational Clinical Exam paper by D'Silva et al, a cut-off of â‰¥20 increased the likelihood of bladder outlet obstruction (positive LR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), whereas scores of less than 20 had an LR that included 1.0 in the 95% CI (negative LR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.00)[1].

## Scoring

Each question is scored from 0 to 5 for a maximum score of 35 points.

**The first six questions are scored based on the following[2]:**
- Not at all (0)
- Less than 1 time in 5 (1)
- Less than half the time (2)
- About half the time (3)
- More than half the time (4)
- Almost always (5)

The seventh question, relating to nocturia, is scored from 0 to 5 based on how many times the patient gets up at night to urinate (viz. 1 is scored for one time per night and 5 for five times per night).[1]

The eighth, and final question (not included in the main IPSS score), relating to the patient's perceived quality of life, is assigned a score of 0 (delighted) to 6 (terrible).

## Missing data

All questions should be answered in order to calculate a score.
