# Beck Depression Inventory - II (BDI-II)

## Introduction 

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), created by Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression [1]. The BDI has been revised in 1996, partially due to concerns about the influence of somatic symptoms from medical illness on BDI scores. It is now named as BDI-II [2]. Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts.

## Questions and Scoring

The BDI consists of 21 questions about how the subject has been feeling in the two last weeks. Each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3.

## Calculation

The total score is produced by taking the sum of all the 21 items (scored 0-3). The total score can thus range from 0 to 63.

## Interpretation

Total scores ranges from 0 to 63. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.

| Total score | Levels of depression |
|-------------|----------------------|
| [0,13]      | Minimal depression   |
| [14,19]     | Mild depression      |
| [20,28]     | Moderate depression  |
| [29,63]     | Severe depression    |
