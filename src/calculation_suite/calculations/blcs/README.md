# Bladder Control Scale (BLCS)

The BLCS is based on items from the Bowel-Bladder Function Scale (Turnbull et al, 1992) and the Sickness Impact Profile. This four-item instrument provides a brief assessment of bladder control and the extent to which bladder problems have an impact on everyday activities. The BLCS is one of the components of the MSQLI.

## Administration time

Administration time is approximately 2-3 minutes.

## Questionnaire

The original paper-based instrument can be found [here](https://nms2cdn.azureedge.net/cmssite/nationalmssociety/media/msnationalfiles/brochures/msqli_-a-user-s-manual.pdf).

## Scoring

The total score for the BLCS is the sum of the scores for the 4 items.

### Total BLCS Score

Raw scores on the 4 items are summed to create a Bladder Control Scale (BLCS) total score. Scores can range from 0-22, with higher scores indicating greater bladder control problems.

## General comments

Higher scores indicating greater bladder control problems.

## Interpretation

The BLCS is easy to administer and focuses on the basics of bladder control. Given the high frequency of bladder dysfunction among MS patients, the BLCS has high face validity. However, the scale was not designed as a comprehensive assessment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction and does not address issues such as urinary hesitancy and retention, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, etc.
