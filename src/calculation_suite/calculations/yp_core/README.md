# The Young Person's CORE (YP-CORE)

CORE stands for “Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation” and the CORE system comprises tools and thinking to support monitoring of change and outcomes in routine practice in psychotherapy, counselling and any other work attempting to promote psychological recovery, health and wellbeing.

The Young Person's CORE (YP-CORE) is a ten item measure designed for use with the 11-16 years age range.

## Questionnaire

As with the CORE‐10, there are 10 items on the YP‐CORE that measure subjective well‐being, commonly experienced problems or symptoms, risk, and life/social functioning. Items on the CORE measures are scored from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater levels of distress.

Please note that items 3, 5, and 10 of the YP-CORE are reverse scored and this is something that you should take into account when storing responses on your side.

**Example:**

| Answer options item 14      | Answer options items 3, 5, and 10 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0 = Not at all              | 4 = Not at all                    |
| 1 = Only occasionally       | 3 = Only occasionally             |
| 2 = Sometimes               | 2 = Sometimes                     |
| 3 = Often                   | 1 = Often                         |
| 4 = Most or all of the time | 0 = Most or all of the time       |

## Scoring

The total scale score is calculated by summing each response, dividing by the number of items answered and multiplying by 10, thus the range is zero to 40.

## Interpretation

In addition, scores on the CORE‐10 can be divided into categories of distress: Healthy (0–5), low (6–10), mild (11–14), moderate (15–19), moderate‐to‐severe (20–24), and severe (25 and above).
