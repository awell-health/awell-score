# Patient Health Questionnaire‐4 (PHQ‐4)

## Background

The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) was developed and validated by Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & Löwe, (2009) in order to address the fact that anxiety and depression are two of the most prevalent illnesses among the general population. Because these two mood disorders are frequently comorbid and the nature of these mood disorders can make filling out long questionnaires difficult if patients are suffering from fatigue or loss of concentration.

It is a questionnaire with 4 questions that are scored on a four point Likert-type scale. Its purpose is to allow for ultra brief and accurate measurement of core symptoms/signs of depression and anxiety by combining the two-item measure (PHQ–2), consisting of core criteria for depression, as well as a two-item measure for anxiety (GAD–2), both of which have independently been shown to be good brief screening tools. 

The total PHQ–4 score complements the subscale scores as an overall measure of symptom burden, as well as functional impairment and disability. An elevated PHQ–4 score is not diagnostic, but is, instead, an indicator for further inquiry to establish the presence or absence of a clinical disorder warranting treatment.

## Calculation

### Anxiety score

Anxiety score is determined by adding together the scores of the first 2 items. 

### Depression score

Depression score is determined by adding together the scores of the last 2 items. 

### Total score

Total score is determined by adding together the scores of each of the 4 items. 

## Interpretation

### Anxiety score

A score ≥3 suggests anxiety.

### Depression score

A score ≥3 suggests depression.

### Total score

Scores are rated as normal (0-2), mild (3-5), moderate (6-8), and severe (9-12).
