# Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)

## Introduction

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) consist of items 18 self-rated questions. The items are combined to form seven 'component' score, each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score of "0" indicates no difficulty, while a score of "3" indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one "global" score, which range of 0-21 points, "0" indicating no difficulty and "21" indicating severe difficulties in all areas.   

## Questions and Scoring

The PSQI consists of 9 questions. Question 5 has 10 sub questions. 
The components:

- Subjective sleep quality - 1 item; Very good = 0; Fairly Good = 1; Fairly Bad = 2; Very Bad = 3;
- Sleep latency - 2 items;
    - Item 1: < 15 minutes = 0; 16-30 minutes = 1; 31-60 minutes = 2; > 60 minutes = 3; 
    - Item 2 (sub item of question 5): Not during past month = 0; Less than once a week = 1; Once or twice a week = 2; Three or more times a week = 3
- Sleep duration - 1 item; > 7 hours = 0; 6-7 hours = 1; 5-6 hours = 2; < 5 = 3
- Sleep efficiency - 3 items; > 85% = 0; 75-84% = 1; 65-74% = 2; < 65% = 3
- Sleep disturbance - 1 item 9 sub-items; None of the time = 1; A little of the time = 2; Some of the time = 3; Most of the time = 4; All of the time = 5
- Use of sleep medication - 1 item; Not during past month = 0; Less than once a week = 1; Once or twice a week = 2; Three or more times a week = 3
- Daytime dysfunction - 2 items; 
    - Item 1: Never = 0; Once or twice = 1; Once or twice each week = 2; Three or more times a week = 3; 
    - Item 2: No problem at all = 0; Only a very slight problem = 1; Somewhat of a problem = 2; A very big problem = 3 

## Calculations

Sleep latency is the sum of questions 2 & 05a: 0 = 0; 1-2 = 1; 3-4 = 2; 5-6 = 3;

Sleep efficiency = (* hours slept/* hours in bed) X 100%
 * hours slept — question 4
 * hours in bed — calculated from responses to questions 1 and 3

Sleep disturbance is the sum of question 5 sub items b to j: 0 = 0; 1-9 = 1; 10-18 = 2; 19-27 = 3;

Daytime dysfunction is the sum of questions 7 & 8: 0 = 0; 1-2 = 1; 3-4 = 2; 5-6 = 3;

The PSQI score is the total of 7 dimensions. 

The lowest possible score is 0 and the highest is 21.
