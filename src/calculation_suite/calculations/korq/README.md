# Keratoconus Outcomes Research Questionnaire (KORQ)

Keratoconus it is a progressive corneal disease with a typical onset in adolescence or early adulthood, although some cases of severe keratoconus have been reported in children as young as 4 years of age. It is a progressive asymmetric corneal disease characterized by steepening and distortion, apical thinning, and central corneal scarring. 

## Questionnaire

The KORQ comprises 2 scales tool, 18 items in the “Activity Limitation” scale and 11 items in the “Symptoms” scale. Each item has a 4-point rating scale with an additional “not applicable” option worth 0 points.

A score for each subscale is computed only after all questions within that subscale are completed. The overall total score is then calculated as soon as at least one subscale score is available.

## Scoring

All answer values need to be summed up and form the total KORQ score. The higher the value, the better the Quality of Life (QoL)
- Maximum score for “Activity Limitation” scale is 72 point
- Maximum score for “Symptoms” scale is 44 point
- Highest possible total score is 116. 
- Worst possible score when all questions are applicable is 29.
