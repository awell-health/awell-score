# Bowel Control Scale (BWCS)

The BWCS is based on items from the Bowel-Bladder Function Scale (Turnbull et al, 1992) and the Sickness Impact Profile. This five-item instrument provides a brief assessment of bowel control and the extent to which bowel problems have an impact on everyday activities. The BWCS is one of the components of the MSQLI.

## Administration time

Administration time is approximately 2-3 minutes.

## Questionnaire

The original paper-based instrument can be found [here](https://nms2cdn.azureedge.net/cmssite/nationalmssociety/media/msnationalfiles/brochures/msqli_-a-user-s-manual.pdf).

## Scoring

The total score for the BWCS is the sum of the scores for the 5 items.

### Total BWCS Score

Raw scores on the 5 items are summed to create a Bowel Control Scale (BWCS) total
score. Scores can range from 0-26, with higher scores indicating greater bowel control problems.

## General comments

The BWCS is easy to administer and focuses on the basics of bowel control, including both constipation and loss of control. Given the straightforward nature of the items in the scale, the BWCS has high face validity. However, the scale was not designed as a comprehensive assessment of bowel dysfunction.
